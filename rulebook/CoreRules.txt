        The forest’s thickness is lessening,
      with room for paths of turned earth,
  rectangular pits, a whiteness as of mushrooms
             peeping from the ground.
With horror we see from the thirteenth tarot that
 the underbrush is fertilized with half-withered
           corpses and fleshless bones.
     “Why, where have you brought me, Fool?

Introduction
The Underworld blasphemes the earth under the City at the center of the world. Most
games begin with adventurers taking their first steps through the gate to the Underworld

Game Principles
His Majesty the Worm aims to make dungeon exploration fun. It forefronts what might
otherwise be fringe rules for food, light, and time, and shines the spotlight on the visceral
experience of the dungeon crawl.

    Each adventurer has a personal quest (p. 24) that compels them into the lightless depths.
    Once their quest is fulfilled, they can finally retire and rest. Until then, it is a cycle of
    descending into the Underworld and returning to the City to restock and rest.

    The flow of the game consists of four distinct phases, each with its own style of play and rules.

     The Player’s Manifesto
     An RPG is simply an exchange of questions and answers between the players and the GM.
     These questions and answers can have nuance and texture. When playing His Majesty the
     Worm, this manifesto will help you frame your conversations with your GM.

• Be respectful and considerate. If you want to explore

  most recent experiences. Have rivals become allies?
  Have allies become best friends? Have best friends
  become lovers?

• Be funny in character. Be serious in character. Think in

Embrace the chaos
Part of the game is skill. Part of the game is chance.
Sometimes, you can’t be careful or fierce enough to
avoid a test of fate. And when fate isn’t on your side,
you have to embrace it. Having something bad happen
doesn’t mean that you’ve made a mistake. It’s just part of
the game.

It is easy to create a new adventurer. This is on purpose.
If your adventurer dies, throw yourself into the next one.
If your adventurer completes their quest, be excited to
retire them.

Games without consequences have no teeth. How boring
would it be if you knew you would never fail and never
die? The essential gimmick of question/answer with
the GM would be boring: “How will your adventurer
succeed today?” Thus, love the chaos.

     Session 0
     Sometimes, RPG players are expected to create their characters by themselves and
     show up on game night expecting to meet everyone else at an inn. This can sometimes
     lead to problems at the game table. We recommend that the players and the GM get
     together for a session before play starts to create adventurers and talk about everybody's
     expectations. This is called “session 0,” and it can go a long way towards making sure
     everybody is having fun.

     The Call to Adventure
     Creating an adventurer means heeding the call to adventure. When you create an
     adventurer, you answer questions and make a series of decisions. This will result in a
     character with a background, a history, equipment, and connections to other adventurers.

     Track the choices of the Call to Adventure and subsequent play on your adventurer sheet.
     A full version of the adventurer sheet can be printed at hismajestytheworm.games.

 6 Arête
Each adventurer has the capacity to exemplify the
platonic ideal of their kin, which is called their arête.

Arête (AIR-uh-tay) is a word of Greek origin meaning
virtue, gnosis, excellence, and evolution.

Each kin has an arête talent. Unlike talents associated
with an adventurer’s path, arête talents cannot be trained
with experience points.

You gain arête when you perform certain accomplishments
dependent on your kith. The first time you accomplish
each particular deed, put a check mark beside it. When
you have checked off all three of your arête triggers, you
gain your arête talent. See chapter 4 for a list of your
kith’s arête triggers and arête talent.

     NEW ADVENTURER CHECKLIST
If you’re a new player joining a group playing His Majesty the Worm and you
missed session 0, here are the things you need to prepare.



Prior to your first session
• Have your adventurer sheet ready.
• Have your kin talent and all seven path talents written down.
• Determine which path talent you have mastered. The rest are in training.
• Choose items from the Omphalic Market (p. 162) – 1 luxurious item, 5 common items, and as many
  impoverished items as you want. Items needed for one of your talents are impoverished items for you.

• Know your own name.


At your first session
• At the beginning of the session, select two players with whom you have Bonds.
• Say what your adventurer looks like.
• Ask questions. Ask about the game world. Ask about the rules. Ask for help about which actions to take.
  Ask for clarification about how things work.

• Give feedback. Let the GM know how it went. Let them know if there’s something you thought could
  have gone better. Let them know if there was something you liked.



Prior to your second session
• Based on your experiences in your first session, fill out a Bond for every member of the Guild.


At the end of your second session
• Based on your experiences in your second session, either join the current guild or elect to create a new
  adventurer that’s more appealing to you or who meshes with the group dynamic better.

• If you join the guild, sign the guild roster and state your role and marching order.
• If you join the guild, you’ll join their current quest and gain 3 XP.

     The guild roster defines your guild’s rules for looting
     rights. The default contract stipulates that all members
     of the guild split loot equally and funeral rights are paid
     for by the guild.

     As you fill out the guild roster, take a moment to talk
     about your guild’s looting rights, who gets the most
     shares, how expenses are arranged, what happens to
     fallen adventurers’ gear, etc.

     Orcish kin
     It is said that, in the past, orcs served dragons as slaves. There are four orc kins, each
     of which once served one of the four great dragons of old. Then the god Rng came and

             Path of Swords
The initial forays into the Underworld were grisly affairs. It was plaster miners who
discovered the passage into the first level. They curiously chiseled their way into the
antechambers. Like tomb robbers, they discovered gilded treasures and heaps of ancient
coins piled therein. And then they discovered the grue. There were no survivors.

Before the First Crusade was finally mobilized, the death toll rose terribly as the lure
of the Underworld proved irresistible to the very brave and the very foolish. As more of
the Underworld began to be revealed, more creatures slithered out of half-remembered
legends into reality. Strange beasts and malevolent entities crawled up out of the opened
chambers and into the terrorized City. The Cult, at first overwhelmed with the practical
considerations and theological questions the Underworld posed, united the proud and
ancient houses of mankind with fiery speeches. Under the Cult’s leadership, the First
Crusade hunted the monsters that had escaped into the City and encamped themselves on
the threshold of the Underworld, warding the lands of men from further attacks.

It was only during the Second Crusade that it was discovered that those who die in the
Underworld do not stay dead...

               Path of Pentacles
Treasure was, and remains, a powerful motivator for Underworld expeditions. The spires
of the Castle of Crossed Destinies were literally covered in gold plating until explorers
stripped them and hauled the plates back to the surface. The Underworld denizens
possess strange coinage as well: round pieces of gold stamped with the faces of three
beautiful women and a pentacle star on the reverse. Who these ancient sovereigns were is a
matter of great scholarly debate and fanciful public speculation.

By the same token, treasure is the primary motivator for the City’s current system of
adventuring guilds. The fifty percent guild tax on recovered loot is a heavy burden for
adventurers and is much bemoaned. The tax collectors posted at each known exit from the
Underworld are a particularly hated lot, but the City has grown rich from this system.
Of course, these heavy taxes have created a sprawling industry of smuggling, bribery,
and fencing. In pursuit of both relic hunting and black marketeering, “thief” has become a
particularly common profession.

When the Underworld opened, so many went on the quest for the Grail of Mythrys
that a massive support system, both secular and religious, was assembled. Inns and
public houses for the housing of pilgrims, coin changers for foreigners, shops of supply
and purveyance, smithies for armament, chapels and shrines for the devout, charlatans
and peddlers selling false maps and rumors, scribes and lawyers for drafting of charters
and wills, apothecaries for the healing of those returned unsuccessful—all these sprang up
almost overnight. The sign of the Cup has become synonymous for these tradesmen, as
well as having a holy connotation, and is still used today to advertise needful service.

             Path of Wands
The relationship between the City and magic has been long fraught with bloodshed
and sorrow. During the Age of the First Empire, sorcery was used as an act of worship
towards the Crow-Headed Queen——one of the earliest deified empresses. During the Age of
the Republic, sorcery was seen as being fundamentally tied to both monarchists and elves,
and it was made illegal. Still, several cabals flourished in secret. The Age of the Republic
was marked by the increasing fanaticism of witch hunters as they attempted to root out
these hidden sorcerers.

A blanket ban on sorcery proved impossible with the advent of the Age of Dungeon. Too
many trials and foes in the Underworld were essentially mystical in nature. The practice
of sorcery became a necessary evil, and the Cult began to draw up the appropriate pardons
and indulgences.

Today, those who practice sorcery in the City must be licensed and registered with the
crown. Official sorcerers are granted rods of office by the Tower Gnostic and allowed
to join guilds in the exploration of the Underworld. Unofficial sorcery is punishable by
fines, but is largely unregulated as long as it is not performed in the City itself. Still, the
Witch Finder General remains an influential figure within City politics, and his templars
have a much grimmer view of unregulated sorcery.

     The Flow of the Crawl Phase
     A new game of His Majesty the Worm starts at the gates to the Underworld.
     The Crawl begins with the guild taking their first steps into those lightless depths.

                    – The Wise Man’s Fear, Patrick Rothfuss




Despite the presence of otherworldly and strange beings, very few creatures
attack on sight and fight to the death. (Well, perhaps skeletons. They want to
free their boney brethren from the flesh prisons that you’re cruelly keeping
them in.) Almost everything can be talked to, negotiated with, or at least
avoided. See “Disposition” on page 99 for an overview of negotiating with the
GM’s characters.

When combat cannot be avoided, the Crawl Phase transitions into the
Challenge Phase. Once the Challenge is resolved, the Challenge Phase
transitions back to the Crawl.

Mysteriously, the Underworld has a property that preserves life. When a
mortal blow is dealt, the victim lingers at Death’s Door before dying. This
property has prolonged the life of many adventurers who have run afoul of
the Underworld’s treachery.

Those who do die in the Underworld rise again as undead…

Role-playing Disposition
There are seven basic Dispositions: anger, distaste, sadness, joy, surprise, trust, and fear. Each of the seven
Dispositions are listed below, with the core emotional state of each flanked by its mild and intense states. A list of
emotional synonyms is also given, as one of those terms might be more appropriate and might aid in the GM in
appropriately role-playing the Disposition. Some notes are also given as to how a creature with that Disposition
might act in a Challenge.

plays a card from their hand and adds their character’s

might have several characters that take turns over the
course of a round.

      If you’re attempting a feat that seems more complex
      than a Trivial Action and has an element of chance or
      danger—like leaping a chasm, holding a door closed,
      hiding, participating in a ritual, etc.—the GM can call for
      a test of fate mid-Challenge.

      Play any card to attempt a test of fate. However, the card
      played is not counted as part of the test.

      To resolve the test of fate, draw a new card from the top
      of the minor arcana deck. The test of fate proceeds per
      the rules on page 8: You may spend Resolve for favor.
      You may push fate. You may bid your motifs.

• +1 card if there are twice as many enemies as adventurers
• +1 card for each enemy that’s physically larger than a human
• +2 cards if there is an elite enemy
• +3 cards if there is a dungeon lord
(Elite enemies and dungeon lords are defined in Appendix C: Dungeon
Denizens, page 251.)

Each of these additional cards is cumulative. Check to see which are applicable
at the start of each round. Therefore, if the number of enemies decreases, you
will draw fewer major arcana cards.

For example, if there are twelve imps facing four adventurers, the GM draws
6 cards from the major arcana deck. That includes: 3 cards to start, +1 for the
one type of enemy (imps), +1 for having more enemies than adventurers, +1 for
having twice as many enemies than adventurers.

If, over the course of the Challenge, the adventurers reduce the number of imps
to seven, the GM will draw 5 cards at the beginning of the next round: 3 + 1 for
having one enemy type (imps) and +1 for having more enemies than adventurers.

      To successfully escape, the guild needs to make a group

going, which is filling the upper section with smoke
and blackening the wall. Also, the goblins have simple
weapons, like bows and daggers drawn. Behind the

Last, in the hallway you hear a slow “swsh swsh” sound.
You see a huge, swinging blade at the end of a pendulum
bisecting the hallway.

So, right now you guys have one torch between the
three of you. You can see the end of the chamber at the
end of the hall because the goblins have a fire going.
There are basically three zones—your room, the hallway,
and the goblins’ foyer.

T The song has become so popular in guild-haunted taverns that it has trickled out into the general population.
        here is some common wisdom about making encampments in the Underworld encapsulated in a song.

This song is usually called the “Camping Song,” and it’s sung to an ancient melody. The Camping Song runs thus:


        O! Underneath hill and barrow go                                 Isles in Moat, ships land upon

      The Flow of the Camp Phase
      When adventuring has left the guild injured, miserable, and expended, they put down
      their packs and set up camp. During the Camp Phase, everyone rests and recovers from the
      stresses of the Crawl.

      The Camp Phase runs thus:

      1. Camp Actions
      Set up camp and perform a Camp Action.


      2. Break bread
      Consume a ration. If you can't do this, check the
      Stressed condition.


      3. No rest for the wicked
      The GM checks for any random Camp events.


      4. Recovery
      Automatically refill your allotment of lore bids and clear
      the Staggered condition. For every charged Bond you
      burn, heal 1 Wound or regain 1 point of Resolve.

      • If you are Stressed, you must burn a charged Bond to
        erase this condition first. Being Stressed prevents you
        from healing Wounds or recovering Resolve.

      • If you are Injured, you must burn a Bond to clear this
        condition before you can heal any Wounded talents.


      5. End of Camp Phase
      Check to make sure you have at least two of the
      following: bedroll, tent, or fire. If you don’t, you wake
      up Stressed.




          The pace of travel
          Rations are the resource that drive the Camp
          Phase. As such, the opportunity to perform
          Camp Actions is dependent on the guild’s
          ability to manage their inventory. Likewise,
          because charged Bonds drive step 4 of the
          Camp Phase (Recovery), you have an impetus to
          avoid striking camp too often: only after a good
          exchange of role-playing scenes.

                                            the adventurers are camping in (p. 91). Random events like rainstorms and rising
                                            fog will add flavor to the Camp Phase, but probably won’t impose any special
                                            rules. If a random encounter is pulled, the Camp Phase is interrupted
                                            by a Challenge.

                                            It is assumed that adventurers are taking turns guarding the camp while they
                                            rest. If a random encounter occurs, the GM should randomly determine who’s
                                            on watch. An easy way to do this is to look at the top card of the minor arcana
                                            discard pile: the suit displayed corresponds to the path of the adventurer on
                                            guard. If there are multiple adventurers of the same path, odd cards target the
                                            player to the GM’s left, even cards target the player to the GM’s right.

      The Flow of the City Phase
      When the guild returns to civilization, laden with treasure and light on supplies, the City
      Phase begins. The City Phase is an opportunity to pursue long-term goals, research the
      next steps of the quest, and restock supplies before returning to the Stygian depths. This
      chapter details what players need to know about the City Phase. Advice for the GM for
      running the City Phase is found on page 190. Procedures for the GM to flesh out a City
      are found in Appendix D: City Creation.

      Here is the summary of the City Phase:

      1. Death and taxes                                         5. Upkeep

      3. City Events
      The City is never dull. When you stagger back to the         Rumors (XI–XV): Rumors hint at the contents of the
      surface, you enter a chaotic metropolis with all its         Underworld: treasures, monsters, traps, hazards, and

Example City Events

  I.     [Curiosity] Gross: A bucket of night soil is emptied onto a random adventurer from a high-up window.

         [Curiosity] Doggy: A starving dog trails behind the guild, whining. Its ribs stick out and its pink skin

 III.    initiation pronounces a sentence of death on a hooded man for the crime of punching a noble and
         subsequently loosening the noble’s tooth. To loud applause, the man drops and jerks on the gibbet.

         [Curiosity] Stylite: From his high pillar, a naked stylite pronounces doom down on the adventurer
         with the highest Wands score. The stylite loudly decries their vices and denounces their escapades

         as lecherous and murderous. He seems to know a lot about the adventurer, honestly. It would be
         impressive if it wasn’t so mean and truthful.

         [Curiosity] Lick Lick Lick: An old woman, drunk as a skunk, sits in the gutter singing an old-

         fashioned tune. She doesn’t seem to notice the bloated rat licking her ankles.

         [Happening] Famine: A long winter has left the granaries empty. Food is scarce. You can only buy
 VI.
         rations if you maintain a luxurious lifestyle during step 5 (Upkeep).

         [Happening] The Ecstasy of St. Naos: By far the biggest party day of the year: like St. Patrick’s and
 VII.    Mardi Gras had a baby. The City is shut down. The only City Action the adventurers can perform
         during step 6 (City Actions) is Carousing.

         [Happening] The Feast of the Constellations: During the Feast of the Constellations, the pious of the
 IX.     Cult fast. By custom and law, all taverns are closed and the drinking of alcohol is punished by use of a
         scold’s bridle. Carousing cannot be performed during this phase.

         [Happening] The King is Dead, Long Live the King!: The old ruler is gone (assassinated? death
  X.     faked? exiled?). The GM must determine who now sits the throne over the City. The players should
         expect changes from the new regime.


         [Rumor] The Sporehulk’s Wife: The Sporehulk is the dungeon lord of the Sepulcher. It is said that
         inside one of the chambers lies the barrow of his wife, around which is arranged four canopic jars
 XI.
         containing her brains, her liver, her lungs, and her ovaries. If you eat any part of the Sporehulk’s wife,

               [Rumor] The Star’s Daughter: A fallen star dwells on an island in the Boundless Moat, and his
               daughter came with him into exile. Both star-beings struggle adorably with human culture. The star
       XII.    wishes for someone to marry his daughter. As a dowry, the star will grant a wish to anybody who marries
               her. However, the daughter will interpret the wish. It would be wise to keep her happy unless you want
               the wish to go sour.

               [Rumor] Medusa’s Abortion: A gorgon was recently slain in the Underworld, yet somehow its
               premature fetus survived. The awful, crawling, half-serpentine thing is gnawing its way through the
      XIII.
               Castle of Crossed Destinies. Even glancing at it turns you into stone. That’s why there are so many
               more statues in the Castle as of late.

               [Rumor] The Strangler’s Palm: Inside a hidden room in the Castle of Crossed Destinies is a tavern—a
               haven for adventurers in the middle of the Worm’s own realm. If you can find it, 10g will purchase a
      XIV.
               safe place to encamp and some of the most exotic foods you’ve ever eaten. The password this month is
               “pickle juice.”

               [Rumor] The Tomb of the First Dead: Inside the City of Ruin is a graveyard. The first graveyard,

               the mental control of the three immortal nymphs that live within the Underworld.


               [Travel event] A Theft: The adventurer in back of the marching order is bumped into by a louse-
      XVI.     ridden orphan. Later, as they round a corner, they see a piece of gear that looks suspiciously like their
               own at a merchant’s stall. Several interested buyers are already taking notice.


               [Travel event] A Challenge: A pair of bravos sitting outside of a wine sink make snide remarks about
      XVII.    the clothes of the adventurer with the highest Pentacles score. They’re spoiling for a fight, though
               they’re more into humiliation than actual harm.


               [Travel event] A Proposition: Several whores call down compliments about the adventurer with the
      XVIII.
               highest Wands score. They claim they’ll give them a discount, if the adventurer is so inclined.


               [Travel event] An Inheritance: The adventurer with the lowest Cups score receives a letter from their
               family. A distant uncle has died and bequeathed them a townhouse by the Grey River, complete with
      XIX.
               a snooty butler named Aethelred that hates them. Though initially a boon, this townhouse will soon
               become the center of a web of intrigue that will haunt the guild.


               [Travel event] A Disaster: Fire! After step 6 (City Actions), the inn the guild is staying at catches fire.
       XX.     This prompts a test of Pentacles to escape quickly. If anybody fails, they leave behind the two items in
               the very bottom of their pack and begin the next Crawl with the Stressed condition.


               [Signs and Portents] Strange Days: The GM notes the top card on the minor arcana discard pile and

      The Omphalic Market
      No tale tells what ancient power minted the ubiquitous star-marked golden coins that
      sit in the treasure hoards of the Underworld. But all know that these coins have become
      the de facto standard of the City. Coinages of lesser metals have become worthless. As
      guilds have hauled back vast quantities of glittering gold, merchants of the great Omphalic
      Market will only accept Underworld gold as payment.




       “In the Plaza of Dark Delights, which lies seven blocks south of the Marsh Gate
         and extends from the Fountain of Dark Abundance to the Shrine of the Black
        Virgin, the shop-lights glinted upward no more brightly than the stars glinted down.
          For there the vendors of drugs and the peddlers of curiosa and the hawkers of
         assignations light their stalls and crouching places with foxfire, glowworms, and
                 fire-pots with tiny single windows, and they conduct their business
                            almost as silently as the stars conduct theirs.”
                                     – “Bazaar of the Bizarre,” Franz Leiber

                                Candles provide bright light for the person carrying them, but don’t provide
                                any light for those nearby. As such, they are used when the guild—as a whole—
                                prefers stealth. Candles can be snuffed out and relit (whereas torches cannot
                                be). Candles go out when dropped. Candles can flicker 2 times before they’re
                                used up (p. 95).


                                Chain
                                Chain comes in 10’ lengths per slot. Chain is useful for all sorts of bindings
                                and haulings.


                                Chalk
                                Chalk can make marks almost anywhere—useful for plotting your way around
                                a maze, warning fellow adventurers about traps, or making crude drawings of
                                your rivals’ mothers.


                                Clothes
                                Clothes come in several varieties.

                                • Rags preserve your basic dignity, but make you look like the worst sort of
                                  peasant.

                                • Common clothes won’t make you popular at parties, but they’re serviceable
                                  and good for dirty work.

                                • Finery sets you apart from the general rabble. Be careful, though;
                                  adventuring has a tendency to make you dirty and bloody.

                                The clothes that you’re wearing aren’t in your pack and don’t take up any slots.
                                Spare sets of clothes take 1 slot in your pack.


                                Cooking gear
                                Cooking gear is needed to prepare hunted game into edible food during the
                                Camp Phase.


                                Crowbar

                                Falconry gear
                                Falconry gear includes gloves, tethers, hoods, and everything needed to enjoy
                                the royal sport of hawking.


                                Fishing gear
                                Fishing gear is needed to fish and gather food on bodies of water—like in the
                                deadly Boundless Moat.

Torches provide bright light to the person holding them and dim light
for everybody else in the guild. Torches have a 50% chance to go out when
dropped. Torches that are extinguished are almost impossible to relight.
Torches can flicker 3 times before they’re used up (p. 95).


Wand of archwood
Wands of archwood are ritual implements that allow sorcerers to focus their
magical potential. If you have the Gramarye talent (p. 82), you may use an
archwood wand as a missile weapon to create blasts of magical energy up to a
zone away.


Weaponry
Weaponry includes any basic arms and ammo listed in the Weapons section on
the following page.

• Silver weaponry is expensive, but silver is often useful against lycanthropes,
  spirits, and certain types of undead. Silver weaponry is soft and easily damaged,
  however. Silver weapons can only absorb 1 Notch before being Destroyed.

Wolfsbane repels wolves and lycanthropes. If brandished, test Wands. If
successful, Displace one affected creature. During a Challenge, brandishing
wolfsbane is a Wands action.




 “To train with the sword, first master sweeping. When you have
 mastered sweeping, you must master the way of drawing water.
Once you have learned how to draw water, you must split wood.
Once you have split wood, you must learn the arts of finding the
  fine herbs in the forest, the arts of writing, the arts of paper
making, and poetry writing. You must become familiar with the
 awl and the pen in equal measure. When you have mastered all
  these things you must master building a house. Once your house
is built, you have no further need for a sword, since it is an ugly

Alisander chooses the spells Brainfever, Control Undead,
and Necromancy. He writes these components down on his
adventurer sheet, with each component taking a slot.

Step 7. Plan the next Crawl
GM: OK, so everybody has their actions done. Uh, let’s
see. You all meet back up at a tavern. Do you want to go
back to the Rat Cellar?

Weela: Ha ha, yes yes.

GM: OK, you descend the familiar crumbling stairs down
into the basement bar. You get your cups and pull yourself
a draft of the terrible, licorice-smelling liquor called rat’s
milk. The same unsavory characters as always are there—
arm wrestling, getting in spitting contests. There’s a job
board in the corner. A big rat is gnawing on the cork of
the board. What do you all do?

Lucind: I go over, try and pet the rat, then read the
job board.

The GM has pre-constructed a table of contracts. They draw 5
cards and read the corresponding contracts to the guild.

The guild role-plays together. None of the contracts sound
particularly appetizing to them for one reason or another. They
did not complete Alisander’s quest last Crawl, so they will
continue pursuing that goal. They briefly discuss what they
think their leads are. The guild decides to try to go towards the
Sepulcher of Titans dungeon.

Step 8. Restock the Underworld
After the session, the GM opens up their notes document and
goes into their random tables—specifically, their Meatgrinder
table and their City Events table.

They delete the entries on the Meatgrinder table that have been
drawn. After thinking a little about how the factions in the
Underworld have changed because of the guild’s actions, they
write some new Meatgrinder entries.

They delete the old City Event rumor about the star-daughter.
They write a new rumor based on the Meatgrinder entries they
just wrote.

The GM looks over their maps and makes sure they’re all
up to date.

In general, the GM doesn’t create new “plot.” They
just think about the environment and make notes about
potentially interesting consequences that could arise from
the adventurers’ actions.

players. Be charitable in the information you give: the
more information a player has, the more interesting
choices they can make. So, even in a room with a secret
door, the adventurer might feel a slight draft in the room
that reveals that something is amiss. Or if there was a
thief behind a curtain, they might hear a muffled cough
for a moment, but then nothing.

184         CHAPTER 10       |   THE WORM TURNS: GAMEMASTERING
Creating interesting battles
Your job as the GM is to keep the Challenge flowing. You track the Initiative
count, lead discussions about rules, and make rule calls when players attempt
different types of actions. And, importantly, you control the antagonists during
the Challenge.

Here are some lessons learned during playtesting to help you create tactically
difficult and rewarding Challenges.


Gang up on the players
Players have more cards in total than the GM. They will act more often.
However, you have an advantage when it comes to the number of antagonists.

• With multiple enemies, each action you use can target the same number of
  adventurers. If five goblins use the Attack action, this will affect up to five
  different adventurers.

  • Enemies can also focus fire, attacking the same adventurer. Use the rules
    for mobs on page 122 to good effect.

• The GM’s “side” can often absorb more Wounds than the players.
The gimmick is that players feel cool as they mow down hordes of zombies or
bandits or whatever. At the same time, it’s a war of attrition—the GM can put
pressure on the players as they face hordes of enemies.


Make minor actions as often as possible
You have much more freedom than players when it comes to card choice
because you don’t have to worry about card suits. As such, take minor actions as
often as possible.

Smart players will try to keep the monsters “stun-locked” with Roughhouse
and various effects. Smart GMs will use Recover, which doesn’t have a requisite
value—simply discard any lesser doom card as a minor action to keep your
antagonists free and ready to act.


Fight dirty, fight fair
Don’t pull punches, but fight fair. Don’t change your monsters’ stats halfway
through a battle. If the players come up with an amazing plan and shove your
big bad guy off of a tower, let it happen. Of course, what is good for the goose
is good for the gander. If the players start shoving your Balrog off the Bridge
of Khazad-dûm, you can pull their wizard off of it just as easily (if you have the
appropriate card).

If the players are losing, they have a choice to make: stand and fight, run away,
or talk their way out of it. The Disposition and Morale rules make sure that the
players have ample opportunities to talk their way out of a fight at pretty much
any stage.




                                                    CHAPTER 10        |   THE WORM TURNS: GAMEMASTERING   185
      Creating interesting antagonists
      Challenges that just consist of “smack the other guy dead” can be boring. Make
      fights with goals other than defeating the enemy. To this end, create antagonists with
      potential energy.

      For example, if a Meatgrinder encounter simply lists “1–4 skeletons,” the Challenge
      Phase will consist of the antagonists whacking each other until one side expires from
      Wounds. However, if the Meatgrinder details, “1–4 skeletons in a pit that seem to be
      guarding a skeleton with a golden crown; the crowned skeleton is not moving,” the
      encounter gains more texture and raises several questions:

      • Can the adventurers get the crown off of the king skeleton safely?
        • What happens if they do? Does this trigger something?

      • What is the story of these undead? How does it
        relate to this region of the Underworld?

      • How can the pit be safely navigated by the
        adventurers?

      As the guild moves through the Underworld,
      the potential energy from one antagonist
      will transfer onto another until eventually
      there is an explosion—with the players
      caught in the middle.




186        CHAPTER 10       |   THE WORM TURNS: GAMEMASTERING
Creating surprises
If things are beginning to get stagnant, introduce something that changes the Challenge dramatically. Let the
potential energy transfer into kinetic energy.

Here’s a table to inspire ideas for different ways to shake things up. Glance at the top of the minor arcana discard pile
for a random event:

     II     A wandering monster wanders into the scene.

    III     An infantile wandering monster wanders into the scene. It imprints onto a random adventurer.

     IV     A rival adventuring party, currently struggling with problems of their own, crash onto the scene.

     V      Something in the current scene is revealed to only be an illusion.

            Something in the scene is revealed, with further investigation, to be something completely different.
     VI
            The orc is just three goblins in a trench coat. The gargoyle is just a statue.

    VII     A secret passage is revealed, leading to hidden treasure or danger.

            The spirits have their own agendas. What do they want?

  Knight    distinctly remember a preternatural voice speaking to them. What is this divine revelation? Is it real? Or
            is there something going wrong in the unknowable space behind their eyes that’s undiagnosed?

   Queen    Death shows up and stands quietly in the corner. He’s a few minutes early, but is willing to wait.

            A stampede of doppelgangers barrels down the passage and accidentally bumps into the guild. They
            get all tangled up, tripping over each other. After the confusion, the party is substantially larger. Each
   King
            player has at least two, but maybe as many as four new adventurers. Not even the players are sure who is
            who. Give them new adventurer sheets for their clones until things are sorted out.

      Running the Camp Phase
      Camping scenes are moments of relative calm within the frenetic journey of the
      Underworld. They are explicitly times for a guild to regroup, role-play with each
      other, and recover near the warm light of the campfire before moving on into the waiting
      darkness; a time for the whole table to breathe a sigh of relief.

      The GM’s job is two-fold during the Camp Phase:             Whenever the players riff on these questions, they

      Running the City Phase
      Social encounters in the City aren’t like social encounters in the Underworld. In the
      Underworld, the characters are invaders. In the City, characters are part of the ecosystem.
      That is a fundamentally different paradigm.

      Through role-playing, the City blooms for the players. However, the players must find
      the appropriate keys for the gates that are placed in front of them. The GM’s job is
      threefold: Find what goals the players have, clearly define what is needed to achieve those
      goals, and create interesting obstacles.
