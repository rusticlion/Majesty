      The Far Realms
      There are four realms of spirits, sometimes called the “far realms,” that are tangent to the
      plane of Flesh, where men and dwarves and dogs and cows and all other mortal creatures
      live. These are called the Wastes, the Weald, the Weird, and the Welkin. All magic has
      its origin in one of these realms.

         What is an “animal”?
         If it might have appeared in a medieval bestiary,
         it was probably an animal. This includes stuff
         like krakens and owlbears and cockatrices, yes.
         It doesn’t include things like skeletons and
         golems. Animals eat and shit in the woods.

                 Alchemy
  “That night the King walked late in his chamber in the Iron Tower alone. His
jars and flasks and bottles of blue and green and purple glass wherein he kept his
 cursed drugs and electuaries of secret composition, his athals and athanors, his
 crucibles, his horsebellied retorts and alembics and bainsmaries, stood arow on
    shelves coated with dust and hung about with the dull spider's weavings. .
 The King was deep in his contemplation, with a big black book open before him on
the six-sided reading-stand: the damnablest of all his books, the same which had
taught him aforetime what he must do when by the wicked power of enchantment
            he had wanted but a little to have confounded Demonland
                    and all the lords thereof in death and ruin.”
                                    – The Worm Ouroboros, E. R. Eddison



                          Alchemists are thieves. They are thieves of the worst sort.

                                               They steal souls.

               By butchering out the gallbladder, the liver, the bufonite, the alchemist distills
             the essence of a creature. This can only be done in death, of course, because death
            releases the soul. Distilling these reagents creates an alchemically reactive substance.

                This allows the alchemist to use the powers of monsters. At least, for a while.

                                    You can see why this is a vicious cycle.

Similarly, harvested reagents that are stored outside of a
hermetic environment cannot be used to brew alchemical
substances. They rot too quickly.


What can be harvested?
Creatures in the Underworld are inherently magical. It
is this magic that alchemists exploit. Only monstrous
creatures provide reagents.

Some monsters yield no reagents. A wraith, for
example, has no guts. A magically animated statue has
no guts. No guts = no reagents. The GM makes the
call on edge cases (“Is the blood on a bloodybones
alchemically reactive?”), but in general this will be
obvious to everyone.

Sentient humanoids like humans, orcs, elves, or
underfolk never provide reagents.

      Alchemical Substances
      There are three types of alchemical substances.

      drunk. A sip of a potion is enough to produce the tiniest

      Oils (O) have an effect on the environment. They can be
      poured out, slathered onto items, or have things dipped
      into them to create these effects.

      During Challenges, the Use Item Cups action is required
      to use any alchemical substance, whether that’s drinking
      a potion, throwing a bomb, or applying an oil (p. 118).

      Monstrous Mixology
      The Cocktail Codex makes the bold claim that there are only six cocktails, with all
      cocktails being a variation of one of the core recipes. For example, vodka mixed with orange
      juice is a screwdriver. A variation on this recipe is a Cape Cod— vodka mixed with cranberry
      juice. Similarly, the game designer Chris McDowall makes the bold claim that the same
      can be true of RPG creatures. Every creature in a big monster manual is just a variation
      of one of the core mechanical recipes: an ogre is a strong and stupid humanoid monster; a
      zombie is a weak and stupid humanoid monster. Despite their differences, you can think of
      ogres and zombies as variations on a recipe.

      advanced powers; see page 121 for full details.

      Creature Stats
      A creature is defined by a small collection of stats that make it easy for the GM to
      interpret their abilities during play.

      Here’s a sample stat block of the skeleton from page 277 with some explanatory text. As
      a reminder, capitalized words in a dungeon denizen’s stats refer to effects. The rules for
      effects are listed in the on page 12.

      Skeletons hate the living. Living souls burn like torches in the
      blackness of the Underworld, and skeletons mindlessly seek to
      extinguish those bright lights.

      Skeletons sometimes pick up old and rusted weapons to channel
      their hate, but will also just plunge their bony fingers into an
      adventurer’s eye sockets. Sometimes, they wear rusted old armor.
      If so, give them 1 or 2 points of Defense.

2 Attributes:       Swords 6 | Pentacles 1 | Cups 1 | Wands 4

3 Health/Defense: 6/0
      Likes: Almost Nothing
4 Hates: Life, Sound, Light
5 Notes
      • Breathless and Undreaming. Skeletons ignore any
        effects related to living processes. They do not breathe.
        They do not sleep. They cannot be poisoned. They are
        immune to the Poison Blood of seablooded orcs.

      • Empty Skulls. Skeletons ignore any attempts to
        manipulate their minds. They are immune to the
        Inspire effect. They cannot see illusions.

      • Fleshless. Skeletons are immune to piercing weapons
        such as arrows and spears. Actions that target skeletons
        must exceed (not just match) their Initiative.

    Health/Defense (HD)

      Creature actions
      Rules for the sample dungeon denizens refer to different
      types of actions. It’s our hope that natural language
      guides your interpretations during play instead of a
      relentless pursuit of a pure text legalism. To this end,
      here’s some insight into the words we’ve chosen to
      describe the actions on the following pages.


      Free actions
      Free actions can be performed without playing a card.
      This might be once a turn (e.g., a creature can Move
      once each turn without the GM playing a card) or when
      certain conditions are met (e.g., if a creature is the target
      of a spell, they can Heal 1 Wound as a free action).


      Standard Challenge Actions
      The GM uses the same list of Challenge Actions as the           “Discard a card”
      players do (p. 116). Creatures use standard Challenge           When the GM needs to use a card to activate an ability

      Miscellaneous actions                                           Some creatures’ abilities modify Attack actions.
                                                                      For example, a creature might target two separate

Undead
There are magics that attempt to create deathlessness.
Such magic is omnipresent in the Underworld. These
spells force the body to keep moving even after grievous
injury and shackle the soul to this plane. At the best of
times, this prolongs mortal life. Most of the time, it
creates the curse of undeath.

Undead creatures toil endlessly towards purposes
inimical to life. Some are mindless, killing with the
irresistible but dispassionate power of an earthquake or
mudslide. Some are miserable and seek momentary relief
through the torture and dismemberment. Others are
methodical, deliberately trying to swell the ranks of the
undead by slaughtering the living.

This category includes physical undead
(zombies, skeletons, vampires) and
immaterial undead (ghosts, shadows,
wraiths).

Notes
• Breathless and Undreaming. The undead ignore
  any effects related to living processes. They do
  not breathe. They do not sleep. They cannot be
  poisoned. They are immune to the Poison Blood of
  seablooded orcs.

• Rotting Brains. The undead ignore any attempts
  to manipulate their minds. They are immune to the
  Inspire effect. They cannot see illusions.

Lesser dooms
• Devour the Living. If a living creature is Knocked-out
  or at Death’s Door, play a lesser doom card to devour
  it. This Heals 2 Wounds.

• Fear. Play a lesser doom card and compare its value
  to the Initiative of each character in the same zone.
  If the undead does this on its turn, it adds its Wands
  to the total value. Adventurers it succeeds against are
  Displaced to an adjacent zone of the player’s choice.

Bloodybones
Sorcerous Minion

Most adventurers would assume that a bloodybones is a type
of undead. It would stand to reason: a red skeleton, covered in
blood, threaded together with a simple circulatory system. It
looks like a bloody jellyfish sitting on top of a corpse.

It isn’t undead, however. A bloodybones is a type of ooze—just
in the shape of a skeleton. Perhaps the ooze once absorbed parts
of an actual skeleton? Nobody’s sure. They’re speechless and
unthinking. Bloodybones slorp through the Underworld,
reaching out with sticky fingers to grab and grasp adventurers.

By all known metrics, a bloodybones is immortal. It is
invulnerable to every type of harm. Weapons squish through
them. Fire crackles harmlessly along them. Withering spells
simply produce the unpleasant smell of burning garbage.

Luckily, they are very weak creatures. Each “bone” is like a
condom full of spaghetti. They’re soft and easily dealt with.
Clever adventurers can stick them into iron maidens,
push them into pits, or simply walk away from them at a
brisk pace.

Notes
• Immune to Damage. Bloodybones have infinite
  Health. They never actually take a Wound, no matter
  what is done to them.

• Smell Magic. Bloodybones can smell magical effects.
  They can identify who is and isn’t a sorcerer by scent.

A bloodybones has no specific lesser or greater dooms.
They use the standard list of actions during a Challenge.

Notes
• Eat-Eat-Eat. The ogre can play any card to eat an

   • Ogres can eat damn near anything. Given time, the
     ogre can chew through stone doors or iron bars.
     Nothing they eat harms them in any way. Ogres
     cannot be poisoned and are immune to the Poison
     Blood of seablooded orcs. They can even swallow
     potent artifacts like cursed magic rings without ill
     effect.

• That Hideous Strength. Ogres have strength to rival
  that of trolls. The ogre can play any card to lift a
  portcullis, smash down a door, pull a stone from a wall,
  or perform other incredible feats of strength.

• Tough. Actions targeting ogres must exceed (not just
  match) their Initiative.

Skeletons hate the living. Living souls burn like torches in the

extinguish those bright lights.

Skeletons sometimes pick up old and rusted weapons to channel
their hate, but will also just plunge their bony fingers into an
adventurer’s eye sockets. Sometimes, they wear rusted old armor.
If so, give them 1 or 2 points of Defense.

Special rules
• The Sporehulk itself is a battlefield. Its body is
  separated into four separate sections, each one of
  which is a zone and an antagonist in its own right.

• The Sporehulk consists of its Legs, its Torso, its
  Left Arm and its Right Arm.

• Each section of the Sporehulk has a lesser and
  greater doom associated with it. If a particular
  section is disabled, entangled, or defeated, it can no
  longer use those abilities.

• An adventurer can climb on the Sporehulk by using
  the Dash action. This allows them to move up or down
  one section at a time. An adventurer can target any
  section they are currently climbing with melee attacks.
  While standing on the ground, melee attacks can only
  target the Sporehulk's Legs.

Mapping the City
This appendix contains optional rules for creating an evocative City-scape for your games.
Using these rules, you define the different districts of your City. We provide example
districts, each with a name and a brief description. Each entry includes some sights and
sounds visitors might encounter. Many entries have an example rumor that the GM can
use when the players visit that district. Lastly, each entry has special City Actions that
are available for adventurers who visit that district.

The GM uses the details of the different districts to add
fantastic color to the City Phase.

The GM lays down random minor arcana cards to create a City layout. At the end of
this procedure, your City will have a ruler and 4– to 20 unique districts. The GM should
make a simple map of the City to list the different districts and special actions available.
The basic procedure is as follows:

The Ossuary is a catacomb lined with bones. The bones
are laid out in artistic, elaborate patterns. Entire walls are
filled with frescoes depicting religious scenes, all set with
the tiny bones of the hands of infants. The Ossuary is a
religious space, a practical necessity, and a work of art.

All of this was threatened by the coming of the
Underworld. As the sisters of the Silent Order expanded
the Ossuary, they came upon something new: a door
carved of ivory. Through it came monsters.

A series of crusades quelled the incursions, and today
the Ossuary is now mostly quiet. It serves as a membrane
between the Underworld and the lands of the living.

I OF SWORDS
The Mortuary of the God-Kings
When the ancient god-kings died, their holy bodies were interred in the
Mortuary of the God-Kings to be worshiped. When the Mythric faith took hold
of the City, this pagan shrine was re-dedicated to martyrs and martyrdom. As
such, it is a common place of pilgrimage for would-be crusaders.

The building is a testament to the limits of architecture. It boasts an enormous,
free-standing dome and a veranda of Doric columns. Beneath the flagstones, all
of the god-kings of old are buried. Enormous statues bearing their stylized half-
animal, half-human seemings are set in alcoves around the main dome.

Sensations:
Echoing voices. You can hear the prayers of supplicants hundreds of yards away. Enormous
statues with bestial faces. Incense and smoke mingle together in the air, leaking their way
out of the bright oculus in the center of the dome.

Special City Action:
• Pale prophecies: Sometimes, the old deified kings murmur things at night. If
  you spend the night in the Mortuary, you might hear the kings whisper their
  sad and perplexing prophecies to each other.


II OF SWORDS
The Temple of Strength
A sacred gymnasium dedicated to the eighth incarnation of the Monad. Exercise
and games of all kinds are practiced here. Participants in the City’s public games
gather here to train and socialize. It is a spectacle of aesthetics aspiring toward
peak physical perfection.

For the most part, those entering the Temple of Strength disrobe completely.
Artists and sculptors linger here to perform anatomical studies on the athletes.

Sensations:
The scents of sweat, oil, and analgesic mingle in the air. Men and women strain in
concert, in conflict, or alone. Sand scrapes against the floor as two wrestlers attempt to
gain purchase against each other. A gymnasiarch counts rhythmically to structure some
exercise. The air is cool and damp from the bath steam.

Special City Actions:
• Get autographs: One of the most celebrated athletes in the City is willing to give
  autographs to promising young athletes who frequent the Temple of Strength.

• Wrestle Hereclus: Nobody is able to defeat Hereclus the Strong in wrestling
  as long as his feet are on solid ground. There is a standing prize of 500g for
  whoever is able to beat him. So far, no one has been successful.

                              Hangman’s Hill
                              Hangman’s Hill is the district that executioners have historically used for their
                              grim work. At the hill’s summit, an ancient, hunchbacked gallows stands. Peasants
                              and princes, heretics and saints have all found death here.

                              Whenever there’s an execution, folk from all over the City attend. The
                              district’s street vendors and thermopolia are particularly famous because of
                              this. Otherwise, the district is somewhat lonesome. The few natives are strange,
                              reclusive, and just a little canny.

                              Sensations:
                              In the dying red sunlight, old women spit at you ritualistically. A crow’s cage creaks,
                              its skeletal inhabitant partially spilling out of the iron bars. The tang of rust, iron, and
                              excrement lingers here. Distantly, a dog howls.

                              Special City Action:
                              • Explore Hangman’s Hill: By all accounts, Hangman’s Hill is haunted. If
                                you’re brave enough, you can journey into this district at night and see if the
                                dead have anything of any worth.

                              Iron Street
                              A squat black hill where the City’s smithies are housed. Here, you can purchase
                              exquisite works wrought in iron and steel. Fitted armor and bespoke weaponry,
                              beyond what one can purchase at the second-hand retailers in the Omphalic
                              Market, are available here. The higher you climb on Iron Street, the better
                              quality and more expensive the shops.

                              This is where you go if you want an iron helm shaped like a bull, a pair of swords
                              with Venus de Milo nudes as hilts, or a set of armor to fit your weird hunchback.

                              Due to the proliferation of iron in the titular street, no magic can be cast on
                              Iron Street.

                              Sensations:
                              The street is crowded and meandering. Ruined, rusty swords form mundane shapes: sign
                              posts, weather vanes, hand-rails. The black smoke of a thousand smithies hangs over this
                              hill. There is the smell of a dozen different fire accelerants. It tastes like a licked penny.
                              Hammers ring like chiming bells day and night. An awful confluence of aggravating
                              elements to the nose, eye, and tongue.

                              Rumor:
                              It is said that an elf named Tistusket Wrath-of-God is the greatest swordsmith
                              of all time, forging as many as three magic swords. It’s also said he fucked off
                              down to the Underworld. Several people are paying a high bounty for him to be
                              brought back alive.

                              Special City Action:
                              • Duel: Sword nerds hang out on Iron Street and argue about sword theory. If
                                you get in an argument with them, they’ll challenge you to a duel. If you win,
                                you get their sword. Some of them carry pretty sweet swords.

The Vinegar District
The City has taverns and winesinks at just about every corner and intersection.
However, by far the greatest concentration of bars is in the Vinegar District.
Extending thirteen blocks, the Vinegar District is famous for fermented
food and beverages of all kinds, with each tavern having its own specialty.
Somewhere in this district, you can buy fermented rat’s milk as well as “distilled
regret,” “mermaid’s tears,” and “literal human blood.” You’re not sure that the
bartenders are joking about those names.

Sensations:
Open vats of fermenting food and drink create a powerful ammonia-like smell. Clouds
of fruit flies thicken the air. A few streets away, a conga line of dancers make their way
toward you. There is a sound of breaking glass as a barroom brawl spills into the streets.

Special City Action:
• Loosen lips: Taking patrons to the Vinegar District is an excellent way to
  loosen their tongues about sensitive subjects. Test fate to ask a GM character a
  direct question they normally wouldn’t answer. Instead of adding an attribute,
  spend gold. You get +1 to this test of fate for each 20g you spend, max +5. On a
  success, they give you an honest answer.


VI OF SWORDS
The Bridge of Mourning
The Bridge of Mourning is supported by nineteen irregular arches over the River
Grey. Houses and buildings crowd its span, like Old London Bridge. There are
over two-hundred buildings, some over seven stories high. It is separated into
two lanes, one going west and one going east. The gatehouse on the east bank is
notorious for its displays of the City’s justice: the severed, wax-coated heads of
criminals rot on spikes in the hot sun.

Sensations:
The rotting heads at the gatehouse, along with the emptying of the public latrines into the
river, create a potent stench. You hear the sound of two chatting old aunties shouting at
each other across the narrow lane. Nearby, an emptied bucket of night soil sloshes over the
side of the bridge into the Grey. The sound of flowing water is constant.

Rumor:
The legend says that long ago, a pious king rode from the City to fight a holy
war against the orcs. During this war, a false report of his death was reported to
his queen, who leapt from a bridge in despair. When the king finally returned
home victorious and learned of his consort’s death, he forswore Mythrys and also
leapt from the bridge. It is said the king was cursed for his blasphemy and still
haunts this bridge. It is for this sad story the bridge is named.

Special City Action:
• Seek the Cursed King: If you seek the Cursed King, you might learn the secret
  of his blasphemous immortality. Test Wands. On a success, the Cursed King
  approaches you and gives you a terrible choice. On a failure, you begin to think
  that he is merely a legend.

                              is taken from the shrines in this district where parents offer their children’s milk
                              teeth to pray for their health. Said to be a place of healing springs in ancient
                              times, the district is still a place where leechcraft is practiced (though the volcanic
                              vents have shifted and left the springs cold).

                              During the early days of the Underworld, the Cult turned the wayside shrines
                              found in this district into hospitals for crusaders. Though active Crusades are no
                              longer happening, the hospitals remain—though now defunded by the Cult.

                              Sensations:
                              The cries of crippled beggars follow you down the street. Clay jars filled with milk teeth
                              sit half-buried in the earth. Digging into the hill like maggots, homeless leechwives make
                              crude shelters. You can smell the lingering scent of brimstone and briny water.

                              Rumors:
                              It’s whispered that those who dwell at the Shrine of Teeth know some magic that
                              can shape animate limbs from the clay of that place—for a price.

                              Special City Action:
                              • Fit prosthetics: If you’ve lost a limb, you can find a (crude) prosthetic at the
                                Shrine of Teeth. Leechwives will measure you for peg legs, affix hooks to your
                                stump, and paint false eyes. There is no cost for this prosthetic outside of the
                                use of a City Action.

                              Bellringer’s District
                              The Bellringer’s District is home to the bulk of copper- and tin-smithing in
                              the City. The Bellringer’s District is also home to much gossip. Barbers, using
                              freshly-honed copper scissors, trade the day’s news with the men to whom they
                              give their morning shave. Messengers from the sovereign of the City often come
                              here to cry their master’s proclamations so that they are quickly shared to all
                              corners of the City.

                              Sensations:
                              Each hour, dozens of smiths toll bells in testament to the sturdiness of their wares. At
                              the canonical hours—morning, noon, and evening—an especially elaborate noise is made.
                              (Redsmiths are given a tax credit for keeping time of the holy hours in this way.)

                              Special City Actions:
                              • Keep an ear to the ground: If you spend time in the Bellringer’s District, you’ll
                                hear rumors of all sorts. The GM tells you one of the rumors on their City
                                Events table.

                              • Spread rumors: You can tell all sorts of tall tales in the Bellringer’s District and
                                find them repeated to you a month later as Mythrys’s own truth. Test fate to
                                spread a rumor. Instead of adding an attribute, spend gold. You get +1 to this
                                test of fate for each 20g you spend, max +5. On a success, you start a rumor that
                                is counted as credible among less discerning citizens.




300   APPENDIX D   |   CITY CREATION
IX OF SWORDS
The Grey Docks
If the River Grey is the lifeblood of the City, the Grey Docks is the carcinogenic
tumor on the heart. It is a nest of pirates and scoundrels who, unfortunately,
control all of the sea-borne commerce of the City. The All-Watch rarely comes
to this district, and the maritime merchants pay hefty bribes to keep it this way.
Despite the anarchy and occasional savagery, the Grey Docks contain a sense of
high adventure.

Sensations:
The Docks are a ship graveyard lashed together into a floating town. Hundreds of
decrepit figureheads stare at each other across the unplanned expanse. It constantly
bobs in the flood of the Grey. As it floats, the ships grind together: the barnacle-coated
timber groans and complains. The air is heavy with the sweet smell of butchered whale
viscera, the brackish stink of the river, and last night’s drinking binge. Pirate shanties
are sung by gondolieri as they pull their flat-bottomed river boats. The taste of salt
lingers palpably in the air.

Rumor:
It’s said that contacts in the Grey Docks can help you navigate the Underworld’s
ocean, the Boundless Moat. If you grease the appropriate palms with gold, they
will tell you the location of a hidden tavern inside the Underworld where you can
book passage across those ever-dark waters.

Special City Action:
• Get tattoos: The tattoo subculture by the river is unrivaled, and all the best
  artists congregate there. This action grants you a cool tattoo.


X OF SWORDS
The Silent Quarter
The Silent Order is a sect of the Cult of Mythrys that believes that the Monad
manifests in the world as Death. This holy order serves as the City’s undertakers.
They maintain the Ossuary, carefully cleaning the bones of the deceased and
arranging them in beautiful patterns. In a metropolis as large as the City, their
task is ceaseless.

The Silent Quarter is one of the entrances to the Ossuary. By visiting this
district, the aggrieved may pay respects to fallen comrades or purchase lavish
funerals to bring honor and fame to the departed.

Sensations:
The Silent Order is bound by vows of silence, and thus an ominous stillness hangs over
this district. Tall, basalt temples reflect the sound of footsteps down the streets and
corridors in an eerie echo. The scent of preserving oils and incense hangs over the district.
You hear the tolling of bells.

Special City Action:
• Visit grave: Visit the bones of a comrade in arms you’ve had a Funeral for (p.
  158). Pay 100g in grave gifts. Cry. Achieve catharsis. You cure one Curse effect,
  with the GM’s permission.




                                                                                      APPENDIX D   |   CITY CREATION   301

                              The Court Martial
                              Officially, the Cult handles matters of temporal justice. Priests of high initiation
                              interpret the City’s laws and mete out punishment or clemency. However, there is
                              one authority higher than even the Cult in matters of justice: the Court Martial.

                              The accused may seek a trial at the hazard of their body. Defendants will find
                              themselves declared innocent on all charges if they manage to find themselves
                              alive at the end of the day. However, the Court Martial is neither fair nor
                              impartial. Combatants may be forced to fight in desperate attitudes: denied
                              weapons, with one hand tied behind their back, facing six man-eating griffins, etc.

                              Sensations:
                              A fortress of daunting size, horseshoed around a tournament-ready courtyard. Battle-
                              barristers, with their traditional white wigs, iron gavels, and armored robes, are often
                              seen strolling the battlements and discussing the finer points of chivalric law. Nearby, you
                              hear the loud arguments of justice being traded between three heartbroken lovers.

                              Special City Action:
                              • Trial by combat: If you are accused of breaking the City’s peace, you may
                                demand a trial by combat at the Court Martial. The GM decides how guilty
                                you seem in the eyes of the nobles of the City and sets the strictures of the
                                tournament based on this perception. Arguing for yourself in Chivalric will
                                definitely help you out here. Then, the GM divvies up roles to other players for
                                the tournament and arbitrates a Challenge. If you survive, you will be declared
                                innocent. If you fail, you will be found guilty and dead.


                              KNIGHT OF SWORDS
                              The Temple Militant
                              There are many orders of knighthood: the vampire-worshiping Order of the
                              Red Maw, the miserly gold-hoarding Order of Golden Splendor, the sky-clad
                              polygamist Order of the Blue Kite. There is no order as famous and infamous,
                              however, as the Order of the Athleta Mythrii—often called “templars.”

                              The templars rose to power during the Crusades. The threat of incursion
                              from the Underworld caused their ranks to swell with young men and women
                              desperate to protect their homes. During the Crusades, the Order of the Athleta
                              Mythrii won much renown for heroic deeds. However, after the Crusades, the
                              City found they had an army prepared for holy war—and no wars left to fight.

                              Sensations:
                              The muezzin from the tall towers of the Temple Militant pierces through the bustle of the
                              City below. The clank of armored knights slowly winding their way up the hill to answer
                              the call to prayer. The scent of horse stables mixes with the lingering smoke of incense.

                              Special City Action:
                              • Seal away: It is the charge of the Order of the Athleta Mythrii to seal away the
                                unholy abominations of the Underworld and keep creation pure (until Mythrys
                                comes again and breaks the Demiurge’s works and reforges it anew). Beneath
                                the Temple, there are deep caves that have been made into prisons. Anything
                                you bring to the templars can be sealed into these prisons, as long as you can
                                convince the holy knights that you are working Mythrys’s will.


302   APPENDIX D   |   CITY CREATION
QUEEN OF SWORDS
The Brothel of Battle
The Swordwhores are a free mercenary company who are one of the most
powerful—and wealthiest—independent powers in the City. Members pay
dues to the Swordwhores and, in return, are outfitted with the best ironwork
that collective bargaining can buy. In theory, when called, the Swordwhores
are expected to go to war—a ready army for whatever noble house buys them.
In practice, the Swordwhores make enough gold through their independent
conquests that they are able to refuse any contract.

The Swordswhores station themselves in the Brothel of Battle, a small district
catering to the unwholesome appetites of the violent. The cobblestone streets
are crammed with taverns with tough and queer sounding names (“SWORD
GRINDER!” “The Bridle and Harness”).

Sensations:
The streets are narrow and the buildings lean against each other. Prostitutes call out prices
and preferences down from balconies. Two get into a disagreement, and one hops the small
distance between their balconies to start a brawl. A crowd of appreciative Swordwhores
gathers. A ribald tune is sung in a nearby tavern. The streets smell like old piss and ale.

Special City Action:
• Join the Swordwhores: For 100g in dues, you can join the Swordwhores.
  Thereafter, you may purchase iron and steel armor with an impoverished
  upkeep during the City Phase (p. 163).


KING OF SWORDS
The Court of Swords
The blood games are one of the oldest, most popular, and most respected
traditions of the City. In the Court of Swords, combatants display their
courage, wit, and strength as they contest in the mortal arts. Victors are hailed as
champions and given honors and riches. Losers are given funerals.

Fights in the Court of Swords are considered profoundly religious by nature
(though the practice predates the Cult of Mythrys). Death in the pit is framed in
terms of sacrifice; those who die become blood offerings to the City itself.

Sensations:
Throughout the district, you can hear the cheers of the crowd. A thousand voices cry
with a sound that rivals the thunder or the ocean. The gates of the Court of Swords are
fashioned in the likeness of two combatants, each slaying the other. Passing beneath them,
a huge inverted bell rings with the sound of battle.

Special City Action:
• Fight!: You can fight in the fighting pits and bet on yourself. How much
  money you earn depends on whether you win or lose. For brevity and respect
  for everybody’s table time, the fight is abstracted using blackjack.

  First, make a bet. Then, play a hand of blackjack against the GM. If you win, you
  win +25% of your bet. If you lose, you begin the next Crawl Phase Stressed. If
  you bust, you suffer a number of Wounds equal to your bust, less your Swords, to
  a minimum of 1 Wound. If this would cause you to check Death’s Door, you die.


                                                                                     APPENDIX D   |   CITY CREATION   303

                                There is a maze of twisted, ramshackle houses in the swamps called Licehouse,
                                and it is the poorest district of the City. The people that live there dwell in abject
                                poverty. In this district, those of the lowest class professions ply their trade:
                                gong farmers, tanners, and knackermen. Orphans and lepers crowd the street,
                                alternating between begging for alms and petty theft. Winesinks sell meat pies of
                                dubious origin that are lovingly called “chewies.”

                                Sensations:
                                Tanneries and pigsties rot under the hot sun. The smell of stagnant swamp and open
                                sewer is all-consuming. The stink seems to manifest in rolling banks of greenish fog that
                                come off of the river and linger in the tumbledown alleyways. It’s a smell you can see. It’s
                                a smell you can taste.

                                Special City Action:
                                • Dispose of bodies: The pig keepers of Licehouse will take body-shaped
                                  bundles of meat, no questions asked. If you have a body that you need
                                  disappeared, take it to Licehouse.

                                Orphanarium
                                The terrible Orphanarium district is populated almost entirely by unsupervised
                                children. Child gangs roam the streets—packs of sometimes beggars, sometimes
                                thieves. Older children take care of the younger ones. The All-Watch are fearful
                                to enter. It’s like Ender’s Game meets Lord of the Flies.

                                How did a shantytown fall under the jurisdiction of orphans? It’s a confusing and
                                contested history. Most scholars explain it as a reaction to how the Mythric Cult
                                handled traditions of sacrifice and circumcision descended down from the days of
                                the ancient god-kings. History aside, the little fuckers are right over there and
                                they’re coming this way.

                                Sensations:
                                Children everywhere: squatting in doorsteps, crouched in alleyways, crying inside the
                                shacks. The sounds of a quarrel. Dogs barking. Games abound: stick and hoop, dice (they
                                gamble with baby teeth), ball and cup, you name it. Pastel-colored, simplistic graffiti.
                                Smells like a locker room and greasy, burned sausages.

                                Rumor:
                                It’s said that a monster named the Bag Man lurks in the Orphanarium, kidnapping
                                urchins. The Bag Man rides nightmares like horses, and uses them to travel easily
                                between the Underworld and the City. If you could defeat the Bag Man, you
                                might learn the secret of how he traverses between these two places.

                                Special City Action:
                                • Adopt: Delving into the Underworld makes some people sentimental. These
                                  people can adopt a child from the Orphanarium. Adopted children don't
                                  accompany the guild into the Underworld, but may be used as support staff in the
                                  City. You may note on the guild roster sheet that your adopted ward is your sole
                                  inheritor and may, if you wish, play as your ward if your current adventurer dies.

304     APPENDIX D   |   CITY CREATION
III OF PENTACLES
The Gambol
The Gambol is a district perched like a carrion crow atop the City. It consists of
ramshackle bridges spanning chimneys, attics, and garrets. Its residents spend
days, perhaps even weeks, never setting foot on solid ground. There’s an old
adage that runs, “People never look up.” As such, the Gambol is favored by
those who want to disappear: debtors, revolutionaries, and deposed tyrants from
foreign lands. Other than the fact that it is an aerial district populated by the
incognito, the Gambol is a normal place. It participates in commerce, celebrates
weddings, and pays taxes like every other district.

Special procedure:
If you draw the III of Pentacles while mapping the City, draw again and place
that district directly below the Gambol. The Gambol is the “top story” and the
second district is the “bottom story.”

Sensations:
The wind whistles, shrieks, and howls between the buildings. Kites serve as street signs
and mailboxes. Webs of rope provide scrambles between houses repurposed from steeples
and chimneys. Bats chase moths across the pale night sky. It’s cold.

Special City Action:
• Lay high: Hide out in the Gambol and let the heat die down. If you do,
  someone that’s angry at you will waste their time and money failing to find you.
  For most offended parties, that will be the end of it. The GM should be upfront
  about how long you need to “lay high,” depending on the circumstances.


IV OF PENTACLES
The Curio Curia
Everybody knows that anything can be bought or sold at the Omphalic Market.
However, that’s not entirely true. Some things are illegal, even in the eagerly
permissive City. Seditious materials, false coinage, human chattel, and dangerous
sorcerous artifacts are never traded in the Omphalic Market. The answer to
economic constraint is the black market. In the City, this takes the form of the
Curio Curia, a shadow economy for any illicit good. Some of the things traded
here are truly vile.

Sensations:
Cramped stalls in dim lighting. A giggling man with few teeth promises to show you
something remarkable if you’ll step behind the curtain of his stall. Disabled waifs offer
you half-dead chameleons for an outrageous price. The shrill cry of a rooster dying in a
cockfight. A slaver extorts the virtues of the human body on the auction block. The scent of
sickeningly sweet perfume. The clink of money exchanged.

Special City Action:
• Fence goods: If you come into a possession that would be unwise to sell
  through traditional channels, you may fence the goods at the Curio Curia.
  If you do so, the GM will set a “fair” price using the procedure described by
  “Prices” of page 158.

                              Little Birds’ District
                              The City doesn’t have a formal postal service, but it does have the Little Birds.
                              This mercantile company delivers messages within the City and to almost
                              anywhere in the Wide World. The hilly neighborhood around their headquarters
                              is named (aptly enough) the Little Birds’ District. Little Birds are marked by
                              their silver bird brooches, slide whistles, and the feathers in their phrygian caps.
                              Their reputation for discretion and success cannot be rivaled.

                              Sensations:
                              The bustling of messengers moving up and down the high hill. Savory smells from the
                              street carts selling a variety of spicy food. The music of street performers and buskers. You
                              hear a play being performed. The pear trees lining the street are in bloom; they do not
                              smell particularly good.

                              Special City Action:
                              • Send letter: The Little Birds will deliver a letter to anywhere in the Wide
                                World for the low, low rate of 10g. It’s a flat rate, whether within the City or
                                without. Discretion is assured. The letter has a 1 in 14 chance of failing to arrive
                                due to the hazards of travel.


                              VI OF PENTACLES
                              Lampwright’s Street
                              In the City, light is a constant concern; in the Underworld, it is literally a matter
                              of light and death. Lampwright’s Street caters to these concerns. Chandlers,
                              tallow-mongers, lamplighters, oil producers, candlestick makers, pyromancers,
                              and linkboys are all piled on top of each other: the narrow streets are crowded
                              with hawkers giving elaborate demonstrations in light-craft.

                              Lampwright’s Street is one of the few districts fully illuminated at night. As such,
                              it is considered “good sport” by many thieves guilds. (This has sparked a rivalry
                              between the chandlers and the thieves; the rivalry is more or less friendly.)

                              Sensations:
                              The stink of rendering whale fat. The smell of sulfur byproduct. Storefronts lit by
                              a thousand lights; lamps, candles, votives, torches, candelabras, menorahs, lanterns;
                              fueled by tallow, butter, fish-oil, olive-oil; casings made of stained glass, iron, white
                              gold, painted wood, bronze.

                              Rumor:
                              Certain ingenious lampwrights are incorporating Underworld materials into their
                              new designs. Several enterprising entomologists are attempting to breed a strain
                              of Underworld inframoths that can survive on the surface. Other lampwrights are
                              trying to lure will o’ wisps into lamps filled with corpse fat. These lampwrights will
                              pay good coin for novel sources of illumination discovered in the Underworld.

                              Special City Action:
                              • Purchase fireworks: You can purchase fireworks for 25g per rocket by using this
                                City Action. They can be set off during a Challenge to great effect—Blinding
                                lights or Piercing Wounds, depending on how close the explosion occurred.

                                • Fireworks are fickle. There is a 25% chance that fireworks will misfire in some
                                  way: rocketing backwards, exploding prematurely, or fizzling out.

VII OF PENTACLES
The Cloaca Maxima
The guts of the City. There is a massive sewer that stretches beneath the streets.
The center of the sewer is called the Cloaca Maxima. It houses the mechanisms
that keep the sewer functional.

It’s not much of a stretch to call the Cloaca Maxima a district. The City’s
population is larger than its walls can contain. Even here, in the churning midst
of the City’s excrement, people eke out a little existence. A universally poor, sad
existence—but an existence, nevertheless. Unfortunately, those who dwell too
long in the vile aqueducts that run beneath the City rarely come out...unchanged.

Sensations:
It stinks. I mean, it literally smells like shit. A smell so potent you can basically taste it.
The grey sluice is always trickling, sometimes flowing, sometimes gushing: the eternally
repeated sound of moving water. The walls drip with mold and brightly colored slime. In
the darkness, something moves.

Special City Action:
• Mutation: Why are you hanging out in the sewer? You know what? Go ahead
  and get a random mutation. There are dozens of great random mutation tables
  out there. Go to a blog you like and grab one. Roll on it. Boom. Now you’re a
  mutant. Hope you learned your lesson about hanging out in gross old holes.


VIII OF PENTACLES
The Mount of Broken Amphorae
The City’s trash heap is called the Mount of Broken Amphorae for good reason:
clayware is by far the largest type of refuse that the City produces. Here, broken
crockery is heaped high into piles. These hills are deadly sharp; a fall from their
heights is death. It is frequently used as a place of executions by criminal gangs.

The Mount is inhabited by a population of homeless people and a large breed of
terrible albino cats; they are bitter rivals. Both groups sift through and scavenge
the City’s garbage. The homeless sell scavenged bits to merchants of the
Omphalic Market. Nobody knows what the cats do with the things they collect.

Sensations:
The terrible reek of refuse: not just garbage, but hot garbage. Flies buzz in thick clouds.
An albino cat, daintily walking down one of the hills of broken clay triggers a small
avalanche. The tinkling sound of breaking earthenware and shattering glass.

Rumor:
The cats have a marketplace of their own in the far realm of the Weird.
Sometimes, they trade the garbage of the Mount of Broken Amphorae for things
lost in the Underworld, then hoard these things in their dens.

Special City Action:
• Doodlebug: To go searching among the broken refuse is called
  “doodlebugging.” Declare that you’re looking for one item that you
  lost in the Underworld—not an item that was destroyed, given away, or
  stolen—legitimately lost. You have a 50% chance to find this exact item while
  doodlebugging.


                                                                                       APPENDIX D   |   CITY CREATION   307

                              The Lichyard Market is the main meat market, a gourmand’s delight, and a
                              grotesque spectacle. It houses some of the finest taverns, popular thermopolia,
                              and cesspools of biowaste in the City.

                              Sensations:
                              The open-air market is a riot of smells. Flies cloud the air. The ground is sticky with
                              blood. Everything Upton Sinclair wrote is true here. The taverns are another matter.
                              Foreign music and obscure languages wafting through the windows. Intoxicating smells:
                              wine, garlic, butter. Raucous laughter. Someone is thrown through a window.

                              Rumor:
                              Miss Kinsey’s Dining Club lives in barely-tolerated infamy. At Miss Kinsey’s,
                              no food is forbidden. Everything from rare flailsnails to ogre testicles to purple
                              shrieker mushrooms are cooked, eaten, savored, and discussed. Here, you can
                              enjoy the other, other, other white meat.

                              Special City Action:
                              • Attend Miss Kinsey’s Dining Club: The cost of entry is: One steak of meat
                                from a strange monster or beast, to be shared by those assembled. If the cost is
                                paid, you join Miss Kinsey for dinner with other adventuring guilds. You may
                                ask any one question about the Underworld and hear something resembling a
                                helpful rumor on the subject in question.

                              Master Hugo Underhill’s Menagerie
                              Hugo Underhill is a corpulent glutton that sponsors a large circus and
                              menagerie. His main attractions are monsters and fantastic beasts captured and
                              brought up from the Underworld. These attractions are hosted on his private
                              estate, a large natural preserve and greenspace in the utterly urbanized center of
                              the Wide World.

                              Is it incredibly irresponsible to jam some of the deadliest and most magical
                              creatures into cages and let the public come view them for a few gold? Absolutely.
                              Still, here we are.

                              Sensations:
                              You hear: See Master Underhill’s Marvelous Menagerie! Be educated by his diverse
                              fables. Be delighted by his animal players. Do not be frightened, ladies.

                              You see: Behind a (very low, rickety) fence, there is a hydra. There is a heavy chain
                              around the main trunk of its snake-like body. It looks starved. It sits in its own shit.
                              Down the path, a sorcerer has cast a spell to make it seem like the mantyger is friends with
                              the lion; both are shaking and obviously terrified.

                              Special City Action:
                              • Harvest alchemical reagents: You can harvest alchemical reagents from
                                monsters in the menagerie for a cost of 25g per reagent. These reagents may be
                                transformed into alchemical substances through the Alchemy talent (p. 78).




308   APPENDIX D   |   CITY CREATION
PAGE OF PENTACLES
The Colonies
The Colonies are an ethnic enclave for the City’s minority underfolk population.
Here, their folkways are practiced: cooking, music, jokes, fashion, and traditions.
It forms an essential stepping stone for underfolk immigrants to the City—a place
where interpersonal relationships, employment, and housing can be established
in the human world. The Colonies also house the underfolk consulate, called the
Embassy of Bronze. The Embassy of Bronze hosts the members of the Council
of Liveries when they come to the City on diplomatic missions.

Special Procedure:
If you draw the Page of Pentacles while mapping the City, draw again and place
that district directly above the Colonies. The Colonies are beneath whichever
district is drawn second.

Sensations:
Lanterns shed pools of soft, yellow light at standard intervals throughout the underground
complex. A wedding is happening down the corridor and you can smell the roast mushrooms
and hear the recitations of the Book of Traditions. Nearby, two halflings argue over the
price of fortified versus non-fortified wine.

Special City Action:
• Commission dwarven mastercraft: The cost of dwarven craft is 50g per syllable
  of the commission. The commissioned item is in some way better than a
  standard item, as determined by the GM. As an example, a dwarven weapon
  or piece of armor may be Notched one additional time. A dwarven lamp may
  flicker one additional time.


KNIGHT OF PENTACLES
Whorestown
Its official name is the “People’s Republic of Pussy,” but most folks call it
Whorestown. The whores of Whorestown rebelled against the central authorities
two years ago. Everybody has been so busy with the coming of the Underworld,
nobody has yet expended the resources to return this district to the yoke. In some
ways, Whorestown is a tiny political experiment in the midst of feudalism. The
women and men who make their living there are experimenting with philosophies
that are hitherto absent in this pseudo-historical fantasy kitchen sink.

Sensations:
Fake, squealing moans. Political slogans and catcalls mixed together. Drunken songs
floating through the night. Clouds of thick, cloying perfume. Brothels painted with bright,
warm colors. Lewd graffiti.

Rumor:
Despite the ubiquity of their services, prostitution is not socially acceptable for the
ruling or clerical classes. As such, it’s rumored that there are literally secret tunnels
to Whorestown from every other district in the City. If you’re looking for a secret
path into a particular area of the City, there’s probably one in Whorestown.

Special City Action:
• Pillow talk: Spend 10g to gossip with the whores as you lie spent, sticky, and
  sweaty. You may ask the GM for one City character’s likes or dislikes (p. 180).
  They will tell you a rumor about that character’s predilections.

                                                                                    APPENDIX D   |   CITY CREATION   309
                              QUEEN OF PENTACLES
                              The Street of Beggars
                              The most impoverished residents of the City live on the wretched Street of
                              Beggars. It hosts leper houses, orphanages, religious mendicants, and a vast
                              homeless population.

                              Despite its residents being in abject poverty, the Street of Beggars is the home
                              to one of the City’s most powerful factions: the Beggars Guild. The Beggars
                              Guild regulates all petty crime. All pickpockets, racketeers, highway bandits, and
                              river pirates pay tithes to the Beggars Guilds. The thieves who don’t quickly find
                              themselves turned inside out and dumped into the Grey.

                              Is every beggar you see some expert thief? Of course not. But it’s possible they
                              pay dues to some faux-beggar that is. If they see something worth reporting they
                              might get a kickback. That’s why it’s risky to speak about clandestine matters
                              in the City streets: you never know what lurking leper might overhear you and
                              report back to their masters.

                              Sensations:
                              If you’re not from the district, it’s almost impossible to move through it without a sturdy
                              honor guard: the lame, widowed, disenfranchised, and orphaned cluster around you.
                              Lice and fleas are stirred by your steps down the street. It smells of dust. Twisted brown
                              mushrooms grow from the wooden planks of the dilapidated houses. You hear the ringing
                              of hand bells warning you that a leper colony is coming up behind you.

                              Rumor:
                              The Beggars’ House is an almshouse providing squalid shelter to the homeless
                              population of the district. It is also the (not so) secret headquarters of the
                              powerful Beggars Guild. Everybody knows this.

                              People don’t know that the Beggars’ House also hides a secret entrance to the
                              Underworld. This is how members of the Beggars Guild transport booty back
                              from the Underworld while avoiding the City’s adventuring taxes.

                              However, anybody using this portal is subject to a more insidious tariff. The
                              ancient masters of the Beggars Guild are entombed in the catacombs of Beggars’
                              House. The thieves that pass through their domain must pay the strange price
                              demanded by these unliving things.

                              Special City Action:
                              • Join the Beggars Guild: For 100g in dues, you can join the Beggars Guild.
                                Thereafter, you may use the Beggars Guild’s secret entrance into the
                                Underworld. The Beggars Guild does not impose a 50% coin tax. They do,
                                however, require that you “donate” one item of their choice whenever you use
                                their secret portal. This might be your most precious artifact. This might be an
                                item of no consequence.




310   APPENDIX D   |   CITY CREATION
KING OF PENTACLES
The Court of Coins
In a lonely quarter of the City is a foreboding building: a strange temple to an
unworshipped god. This is the Court of Coins. The name refers both to the fane
itself and the organization that dwells there.

The Court of Coins is the preeminent guild of assassins. (There are a few others—
the Drownies, the Hashashin, the Cat’s Paws—but none as ancient, noble, or
famous.) They reasonably claim that all things have a price—even a life. If they are
given the appropriate fee for the life, they consider that life forfeit. It is said they
have never failed. However, the fees they ask are enormous. You could usually
raise a small mercenary army for the price of a humble merchant’s head.

Sensations:
A temple with a majestic dome squatting in the center of an ugly island in the middle of
the Grey. Its gates are framed in elephant’s ivory, its doors are carved of heavy onyx. The
temple is completely hushed; none dare speak. You do hear the bubbling of a fountain in the
inner sanctuary. It is dark. Butter candles sit in recesses in the walls but offer little light.
Moths flutter about. There is a sweet smell, like formaldehyde.

Rumor:
Members of the Court of Coins demarcate themselves by one sign only: the
possession of a rare double-headed coin. Before they assassinate anybody, they
slip this coin into the pocket of their intended target. By the time their targets
find this coin and cast it away, it is already too late: they have been marked.

If this double-headed coin is given freely away it can pay for almost any service.
Anybody in possession of such a coin cannot be targeted by the Court of Coins.
“You cannot have two coins,” it is said.

It is further rumored that the original assassin cannot continue their work until
their original coin is recovered.

Special City Action
• Contract assassination: If you travel to the Court of Coins and state the name
  of your target, a non-descript man will quote you a price. This price is probably
  patently ridiculous, but can range from 5,000g to a dragon’s egg. If you pay it,

                               The Thermae
                               Citizens of all social classes bathe daily at one of the hundreds of public baths
                               in the City. The largest of these is the Thermae, one of the largest civic projects
                               ever built. It dominates a dozen city blocks and can accommodate up to 3,000
                               bathers at once.

                               Entrance to the basic pools of the Thermae is affordable for the average citizen:
                               only one or two quartered coins. However, the upper classes have refined bathing
                               into a fine art. Each step of the bathing process—undressing, steaming, cold-
                               water bathing, hot-water bathing, scraping, massaging, relaxation, dressing—has
                               been made into an elaborate ritual. (These elegant spa experiences are available
                               for those who purchase the luxurious upkeep.)

                               Sensations:
                               The bathhouses are designed to give the feeling of immense, open space. Voices echo off
                               of the lofty halls. You hear the sound of splashing in a pool nearby and the rumbling of
                               rushing water from the aqueduct. The tiles are set in elaborate mosaics; they are warm to
                               the touch from the volcanic hot springs running beneath them. Clouds of steam. The air is
                               hot and dry. There’s a lingering sulphuric smell.

                               Special City Action:
                               • Makeover: Is it time to have a dramatic change? Let the masters of the

                               The Perfume District
                               Most agricultural processes (milling, butchering, rendering, composting, etc.)
                               are done outside the walls in the farms and fields that support the engine of
                               metropolitan life. When these things cannot be done outside the City, they are
                               done inside the Perfume District.

                               The Perfume District is so named for the incredible stink it produces. The work
                               done in the Perfume District is grisly. Here, animal carcasses are turned into bone
                               meal feed, fertilizer, tallow candles, soap, bleach, lye, and glue. (Some of the
                               ambergris from rendered Grey river whales does eventually go to the perfumists,
                               but distilling perfumes is not done here. The name is purely ironic.)

                               Sensations:
                               The Perfume District is a gruesome place: they use everything of the hog but the
                               squeal. The streets are perpetually churned with mud and bloody runoff from the
                               slaughterhouses. You hear the blast of the rendering furnaces and see the belch
                               of smoke. The Grey river is choked with the corpses of animals. A visible fog of
                               miasma lays over the district. And the stench. Oh Mythrys, the stench.

                               Special City Action:
                               • Beg for scraps: If you are destitute, you may beg for scraps. Fill your pack with
                                 as many disgusting rations as you want. Use them as rations in a pinch, but they
                                 are nauseating. They work equally well for animal feed.

Stone
Stone boasts the most skillful architects and masons in the Wide World. The
district is their workshop and their showroom. Each architect displays their
masterpieces in the district’s squares, forums, and thoroughfares. The bridges of
Stone are colossal statues providing egress; the public fountains are instruments
that play music as they burble; the apartment buildings rise as high as cathedrals.

Sensations:
Massive monoliths tower around you. Triumphal arches detail conquests of human noble
houses. The white marble flagstones kick up the sun’s light and heat, but long shadows of
towering statues provide islands of cool air. Cathedral-like skyscrapers grow up from busy
public squares. Grotesque faces poke out from the sides of the building, leering down at you.

Rumor:
The gargoyles are not what they seem. Some of them are devils with stone skin
that hide amongst the statuary during the day but creep out to do wickedness at
night. Adventurers brought them up from the Underworld, they did.

Special City Action:
• Commission gargoyle: For 50g, you can commission a gargoyle of anything
  you want. This might be a comical bust of your rival to lampoon him or a
  flattering portrayal of yourself. These gargoyles will thereafter be much loved
  and admired by the folk of Stone.

The Hippodrome of Amet
The Hippodrome of Amet hosts the City’s public games. A full one-third of the
year is dedicated to the games at the Hippodrome. Of these, the chariot races are
the most popular, but they include a wide variety of other entertainment: parades
and processions, foot races, exotic animal hunts, plays and recitals, and public
executions. The need for support during the public games has caused an entire
district to grow up around the Hippodrome. Food sellers, beer brewers, token
takers, animal tamers, janitors, musicians, repairmen, teamsters, and others all live
near the Hippodrome to provide needed manpower.

Sensations:
The Hippodrome of Amet is a large field with a racetrack about a half-mile long.
Stadium seating rings the field in tiers. On game days, the thunder of the horse hooves
and chariot wheels is matched only by the thunder of the crowds. Flute players perform the
sacred songs that start and end each game. The heraldry of different houses flies proudly in
the hot wind. The smells of candied scorpion snacks mix with those of the horse stables.

Special City Action:
• Purchase animal companion: Hunters are sent to the far corners of the Wide
  World for exotic animals to be displayed as combatants in the Hippodrome;
  not all animals brought back make the cut. You can purchase an exotic animal
  for the cost of 100–1000g (based on the animal’s rarity). Each animal purchased
  enters your service knowing one command (p. 78).

                              Humans tell stories of love and romance second only to stories about war
                              (actually, they’re usually related). Rouge Road is dedicated to these stories. It’s
                              filled with shops dedicated to love and lovemaking: prophylactics, tools and toys,
                              aphrodisiacs, wards against venereal diseases. There are many shrines dedicated to
                              the Lovers, an emanation of the Monad that avenges infidelity, creates household
                              harmony, and aids women in childbirth. And, at most of these shrines, there is
                              some tender-hearted cultist willing to perform a hasty wedding.

                              Sensations:
                              The stone buildings are decorated with statuary that ranges from the lewd to the rude.
                              Hawkers advertise the efficacy of their products; some offer free samples. Under an
                              arbor sits a small shrine to the Lovers. Behind it, two young sweethearts are embracing
                              amorously. Cherry trees shade the main thoroughfare. Their blossoms fall across the road
                              and gather into little piles. There is a sweet smell in the air.

                              Special City Action:
                              • Marriage feast: To hold a marriage feast, you must spend all of your gold from
                                your last Crawl. (If your partner is another player’s adventurer, they must do
                                the same.) You gain 2XP by getting married in this way. All adventurers who
                                spend their City Action attending your marriage feast earn 1XP.

                              The Madrasa of Maiden Wisdom
                              Founded by the Crow-Headed Queen and renamed for the mother of Mythrys,
                              the Madrasa of Maiden Wisdom is a public institution of learning. There are a
                              dozen or so colleges inside the City, but the Madrasa of Maiden Wisdom is the
                              largest and most esteemed. It is unique in that it offers free education to anybody,
                              boy or girl, human or non-human. Secondary education is administered by the
                              “Lower Houses,” and covers literacy, arithmetic, grammar, music, and ethics.
                              The “Upper Houses” administer advanced education in natural philosophy, law,
                              politics, history, tactics, and logic.

                              Sensations:
                              The Madrasa is laid out like a little fortress—it’s ringed with white sandstone walls
                              demarcating the boundaries of the campus. Inside, a surprising burst of green: a dell rich
                              with trees surrounding a reflecting pool. Spirited youths chase each other across the dell,
                              followed by a shouting janitor. Stone buildings are lit with mosaics depicting natural
                              phenomena. From an open window, you hear the voice of a scholar intoning her lesson.

                              Rumor:
                              There is a third school inside the Madrasa called the “Superior House.” The
                              teachers in this college are not flesh and blood, but devils, daemons, angels,
                              and genii from the far realms. Students who study under these spiritual masters
                              learn heretical metaphysics. It is said that the ghost of the Crow-Headed Queen
                              herself teaches certain subjects.

                              Special City Action:
                              • Study language: For 200g, you may study the grammar of one of the City’s main
                                languages at the Madrasa of Maiden Wisdom. The main languages are described
                                on page 29. Add one language to the list of languages that you know.

The Plaza of the Stylites
Thirty-some years ago, a Mythric monk climbed on top of one of the pillars in
the public square now called the Plaza of the Stylites and began screaming about
the end of the world. He stayed there day and night, living in extreme austerity.
When the Underworld first opened, he was heard laughing. His last words were,
“I was right.”

Following his example, dozens of other monks have clambered up onto high
pillars and poles in this district. They spend all day arguing theology with each
other, prophesying various flavors of doom, and excoriating the sins of those
who pass below them. They are kept fed by the almsgiving of the citizens of the
district who look on their pillar-saints with bemusement and respect.

Sensations:
A sunburned old man covered in pigeon droppings is yelling at you: “Repent ye vile
Maggots of the Material! You writhe and wriggle in sin, blind to the holy light! You
consume, consume, consume, and you shit, shit, shit. All the works of Man will be thus in
the end! Turn from the temporary and give yourself to the permanent! The time of fires
will soon be at hand!”

His voice trails away as you cross the plaza and enter a small bakery.

Special City Action:
• Doomsaying: If you donate to a stylite, they will give you a personalized
  prophecy. Give the stylite 10g and draw four cards from the minor arcana deck
  for a random prophecy using the table below. If you can ever justify the prophecy
  being true by a generous interpretation of the events of your adventures, you can
  immediately refill your Resolve to full at any point in the future.

  Read from left to right; the suit of the card in each step determines which row

                              The Philosophers’ Forum
                              There is a (currently popular) branch of philosophy that rejects modern educational
                              standards, the esteem of the City’s various colleges, and even the utility of the
                              written word. These iconoclast philosophers hang out in the district called the
                              Philosophers’ Forum. In essence, these philosophers live as paupers (though they
                              would use the term “aesthetic mendicant”), and make a poor living by selling their
                              treatises, giving public recitations, and betting on rhetorical contests.

                              At its best, the Philosophers’ Forum is an intellectual center for the City. It
                              contributes new ideas to ethics, aesthetics, ontology, epistemology, etc. It hosts
                              interesting and controversial personalities. Its nightlife is spirited and lively.

                              At its worst, its citizenship is contentious and argumentative. Factional rivalries
                              manifest and dissolve frequently. There’s little peace and zero quiet.

                              The average citizen of the district finds these street philosophers something of a
                              nuisance, but cannot deny that they contribute a local color to the neighborhood.

                              Sensations:
                              The buildings are in disrepair, even ruinous: standing columns and collapsing arches from
                              ancient eras define the landscape. The forum itself is shaped like a bowl for acoustical
                              reasons. Amid the market stalls, deadbeat philosophers with shaggy beards shelter in old
                              wine casks: they offer poetic recitations in exchange for coin. Ahead, a crowd has gathered
                              to watch two famous old women debate the nature of sapience. The crowd loudly boos
                              them both.

                              Rumor:
                              The Philosophers’ Forum is home to a seditionist element. They claim the current
                              ruler of the City is illegitimate and long for the return of the rightful ruler. You
                              can find these rebels by paying a philosopher with a non-golden coin (rare these
                              days). If the philosopher returns the coin and says, “Money has no use in the
                              land of the dead,” you must reply, “The dead know no king but His Majesty the
                              Worm.” You will then be taken to the underground lair of the rebellion.

                              Special City Action:
                              • Seek truth: An individual philosopher might be batshit wrong about almost
                                everything, but collectively the philosophers are actually very wise. Spend 50g
                                to assemble a crowd and get them sufficiently drunk. Make a hypothesis.

                                • If the crowd cheers the hypothesis, your hypothesis is mostly correct.

                                • If the crowd boos you, your hypothesis is incorrect.

                                • If the crowd begins to debate your hypothesis, it’s incorrect but has some
                                  essential kernel of truth.

                              You can use this City Action to have the GM reveal the veracity of your theories
                              about the nature of the Underworld and its residents.

The Shrine of the Fig of Fate
When the First King of the City died, a fig tree burst through his chest at the
moment of death. His corpse was subsumed into this blessed tree
transmogrification, his face captured into a carven visage of blissful agony. This was
a sign that a new age of prosperity was to come again to the realms of humanity.

In the spot of this metamorphosis, there now stands a small grove of fig
trees, in the center of which is a shrine with a gnarled, ancient, and somewhat
human-looking tree. Since it is a site associated with foundings and beginnings,
expectant mothers visit the Shrine of the Fig of Fate to pray for healthy children.
Some mothers even opt to give birth in the grove itself. As such, a robust industry
of midwifery has grown up in the neighborhood surrounding the shrine.

Sensations:
A line of pregnant women trails down a sparsely forested hill. Merchants are selling jars
of water from the local spring, parcels of dried figs, and small jars of honey. Goats move
through the area cropping the grass. The buzz of bees in the air.

Special City Action:
• Purchase fate honey: When you take this City Action, you may add as many
  jars of fate honey to your pack as you wish; they each take 1 slot. You may
  consume a jar of fate honey during a Crawl to immediately restore 1 lore bid.


X OF CUPS
Alchemists’ Hall
Before the arrival of the Underworld, alchemists were an unpopular profession.
Everybody thought they were virgin losers—and they were more or less right.
But the Underworld is an alchemical smorgasbord: an almost entirely untapped
treasure trove of reagents waiting to be harvested. The implications for power
and riches are obvious. In this light, alchemists have become very popular.

No place in the City has such extensive, well-stocked laboratories as the
Alchemist’s Hall. The gloomy stone buildings are full of instruments of doubtful
and unlawful aspect: fitful furnaces, balances, hourglasses, crucibles, astrolabes,
alembics of phosphorescent glass. The Order of Alchemists will rent these
facilities out in exchange for coin or harvested reagents.

Sensations:
A hill-top campus of stone buildings: laboratories, dormitories, storage silos, warehouses.
White-robed alchemists, busy as ants, hurry to and fro. Foul smokes and vapors
continuously belch forth from a forest of chimneys. A strong chemical smell hangs in the
air. In the underground cellars, jars of glass and earthenware preserve the viscera of
mythic monsters: the pickled eye of the cyclops, the coagulated blood of the hellhound, the
powdered dung of the manticore.

Special City Action:
• Sell reagents: Alchemists will pay good coin for monster parts preserved in
  hermetic bottles. The GM will tell you how much the reagent is worth.

  (A general rule of thumb is 5g x total HD of the monster (p. 125). For example, a
  reagent from a monster with 6HD would yield 30g.)


                                                                                    APPENDIX D   |   CITY CREATION   317

                              The Hospital of St. Berenthu
                              Formal healthcare in the City is only available at one location: the Hospital of St.
                              Berenthu. (Elsewhere, one must rely on barber-surgeons to pull dead teeth, drain
                              boils, amputate gangrenous limbs without anesthesia, and dole out basic first aid.)
                              Those suffering from habitual illnesses are kept for several weeks in dormitories:
                              they undergo periods of purging and fasting cleanses, generous leeching, and
                              visits to underground chambers for therapy by way of “dream amplification.”
                              Those suffering from obvious physical maladies are given morphine-laced wine
                              for sweet sleep and go under the chirurgeon's knife.

                              Sensations:
                              A sprawling complex, half above ground and half below. Dream-like imagery of horned
                              snakes, lambs with human faces, and peacock angels are carved on the cream-colored stone
                              walls. The steps are crowded with lepers, the lame, and the blind: their groaning is that
                              of a vast pipe organ. Poppies grown in flower boxes cannot overwhelm the magnolia-sweet
                              smell of death.

                              Special City Actions:
                              • Rest and recuperate: As long as you are not destitute, you may spend your City
                                Action resting at the Hospital. This heals all Wounds.

                              • Undergo leeching: You may heal an affliction at the cost of 20g per stage (per
                                the rules in the p. 97).

                              The Old Queen’s Library
                              Books were the singular obsession of the Old Queen. So much so that this was
                              the one tax she imposed upon the City: any person passing the gates or docking
                              ship must yield up any book in their possession. These were then copied by her
                              scribes. The originals were kept by the Old Queen, and the copies returned
                              to the owners. She is now long dead, but her enormous collection of scrolls,
                              tomes, and codices remains. The library is kept by the Cult, whose librarian nuns
                              faithfully tend and preserve the books. The library serves as a resource for the
                              Cult’s historians, scholars, poets, and law practitioners.

                              Sensations:
                              Statues representing anthropomorphized arts and poetic genres are set in niches. Bent over
                              long tables, brown-robed librarians reverently bind and mend dry papyrus scrolls. The
                              smell of ink and glue. The sound of a thousand scratching pen nibs against paper.

                              Rumor:
                              The copying errors between the original texts and the copied texts are not
                              mistakes at all but a complicated cipher used by the librarian nuns. By reuniting
                              the original texts (held in the library) and the copied texts (returned to the original
                              owners), you can begin to parse this cipher. But what secrets will the it reveal?

                              Special City Action:
                              • Copy texts: The Old Queen’s Library has texts on almost every subject. Ask
                                the GM if you can find a text on a particular topic. If one exists, you may pay
                                for a scribe to copy a book from the library for you. Copied texts cost between
                                100–1400g (randomly determined by the GM).

QUEEN OF CUPS
The Centrum Bank
As folks from far flung places in the Wide World came to the City, they brought
different currencies with them: drachmas, staters, scripts, aureuses, talents,
cowries. Someone needed to change this money. The Cult of Mythrys stepped in
to fill this role and formed the Centrum Bank.

The Centrum Bank makes high-interest loans to the desperate and the foolish.
They also provide a safe repository for the heaps of gold being brought up from
the Underworld; they exchange a broken chit as a unique ID for any who store
their gold in the vaults.

Sensations:
Sun glints off the gilded dome. There is the feeling of an immense weight above you.
Tall column-like statues of shining marble. Hushed voices. The clink of counted coins,
the squeak of the balance scale, the click of the abacus. Echoes, echoes, echoes.

Special City Action:
• Take out a loan: You can take out a loan of almost any size. It has a 30% interest
  rate. It’s not a great idea.


KING OF CUPS
The Court of the Grail
The Cult of Mythrys is a mystery religion, and its unknowable nature is mirrored
in the Cult’s center of power, a district called the Court of the Grail. There are
twenty-one initiations in the Cult. The higher initiations are wholly unknown to
the lower initiates. As such, it is like many religions jumbled together, as reflected
in the myriad temples of this district.

Sensations:
Some temples are squat, black, and marked with the obscene imagery of devils. Some
temples are tall and gilded. Some orders are masked and hooded head to toe and bound
by vows of silence. Some orders practice sacred prostitution and lie naked on ivory altars.
Some holidays are celebrated with public processionals of venerated mummies. Some
holidays are celebrated through seclusion and fasting.

Rumor:
Anybody can be shown the lesser mysteries of the first step, but only the Secret
Pope knows the last mystery of the twenty-first step, and only the four members
of the twentieth initiation even know who the Secret Pope is. As such, the
identity of the Secret Pope is a thing of much conjecture. Some say it is a child
and that the final mystery is “innocence.” Some say it is a corrupt and bloated
vampire, and that the final mystery is “eternal life.” Some say it is His Majesty
the Worm; nobody speculates as to what He knows.

Special City Action:
• Seek initiation: You are given the keys to the lesser mysteries and join the Cult
  of Mythrys. You begin at the first initiation. If you outrank another initiate,
  you gain favor in tests of fate to positively influence or bully them while in the
  City. When you gain a new rank (including your first), you are told a koan or
  riddle. To advance in rank, you must perform this City Action to try and guess
  the riddle’s answer. If you answer correctly, you advance in rank and are given a
  new koan to meditate on.

                                                                                    APPENDIX D   |   CITY CREATION   319

                               In Prestidigitators’ Theater, puppetry has evolved from a distraction for children
                               to a form of niche high art all its own. At any hour during the day, you can view a
                               variety of puppet shows that range from farcical physical comedies to existential
                               shadow plays. Street vendors hawk simple puppets of all shapes and sizes while
                               larger shops sell bespoke and elaborate puppets, puppet-parts, repair tools, wire
                               of different tensile strengths, and other puppet-nerd products.

                               Sensations:
                               Narrow streets bordered on either side by brightly-painted storefronts and vendor’s carts.
                               Puppets, puppets, puppets: some minuscule, some several stories tall! The alleyways open
                               onto broad squares with outdoor stages set into each corner. Crowds of people of all ages
                               jostle for a good view of the plays. There are bursts of laughter, gasps of fear, and not a
                               few somber tears shed.

                               Rumor:
                               The Puppeteers’ Guild can make puppets that are really, really, realistic. So
                               realistic that you can’t tell the difference between them and living flesh. The
                               guild has some power to animate these puppets from afar. Anybody you meet in
                               the City might actually be a puppet controlled by one of the unholy puppeteers.

                               Special City Action:
                               • Commission puppet: You may commission the creation of a puppet for 10g.
                                 This puppet looks pretty dang lifelike. You can commission the puppet to look
                                 like you or somebody else.

                               Fortune telling of all sorts—even those ridiculous cards.

                               Sorcerers scoff at Newt Row. This hedge-witchery is basically junk (more or
                               less). It’s essentially a tourist’s destination in the City: a place where folks from
                               Far Away can get spooked by a sibyl and pay too much for a blue-eye amulet.
                               Still, for those with a penchant for the weird, Newt Row can be a charming little
                               neighborhood to visit.

                               Sensations:
                               A maze of narrow cobblestone alleyways winding up a hill. At each doorway, an incense-
                               wreathed woman beckons you into her smoky parlor. Shop windows are full of phallic-

                               • Purchase amulets: You may purchase amulets for 10g each. Each amulet removes
                                 disfavor once (doesn’t grant favor). When used in this way, the amulet shatters.

The Lotus Eater’s District
The Lotus Eater’s District caters to lotus addicts, but also sells intoxicants of
all descriptions. Many kith and kin have found surprising ways to get fucked up,
and they can all be found here: dragonteeth blunts, rackety-tam, angelshit, troll
spice, takalashi jelly, etc.

Sensations:
Ghost lotus is growing everywhere: through cracks in the cobblestones, sprouting in the
gutters, choking fountains and wells. At night, its phosphorescent glow fills the district
with a pale moon-like glow. Graffiti artists have painted the alabaster walls with vivid
colors: impressionist art in rainbow fractal patterns. As cellar doors open, clouds of acrid
blue smoke issue forth from them. Someone is lying in the gutter, twitching. Laughter
drifts out of an open upper window.

Special City Action:
• Buy exotic drugs: You may purchase exotic drugs. Black honey costs 35g per
  dose. Ghost lotus costs 5g per dose. (The stats for these drugs are found on
  page 98.) The GM is encouraged to come up with half-a-dozen or so additional
  exotic drugs that players can buy in this district.


IV OF WANDS
Kobalosgaard
By long-standing tradition, the ruler of the City maintains an honor guard of
twenty fireblooded orcs. The reasoning is that orcs, as outsiders, have no political
ties to the factions of the City that would raise questions about their loyalty.

The honor guard dwells in the palace named Kobalosgaard. Its district is
dedicated to the support of the foreign orcs and caters to their curious needs.

The orcs consider their blood oath to the ruler sacrosanct and inviolable. They
will fight to the death in defense of their charge. However, if the ruler does
happen to die, they see no reason to join them in the afterlife. As part of their
pact, the honor guard has the right to leave the City with as much booty from the
treasury as they can carry.

Sensations:
Goblins are everywhere, constantly underfoot. You smell outdoor cook fires smoking in the
bailey. Orcs, off duty, embrace each other while boasting over their cups of mead. In the
practice yard, armored orcs train with terrifying ferocity. The palace, though made in a
human style, has been embellished by orcish artisans with draconic motifs. You realize, too
late, that one of the goblins has relieved you of your purse.

Special City Action:
• Blood feast: For the price of 50g in gifts and the carcass of an Underworld
  monster, you may join the orcs in their revelries. The result? They give you a
  cool nickname that all orcs will call you from now on.

                              Caves are sacred spaces in Mythrism, and hundreds of natural caverns, large and
                              small, are used by City dwellers. Of these, one of the most notable and legendary
                              is the cave under the Plaza Numina. Under this district, there are volcanic fissures
                              that belch forth a noxious fume. These vapors have an intoxicating effect. Those
                              who breathe these smokes experience a dream-like trance. Sometimes they rave
                              or babble. It’s widely accepted that this is a sacred experience. Those who dwell
                              in this district mostly cater to pilgrims coming to huff the vents, like residents of
                              Mecca catering to those on the hajj.

                              The titular plaza is large and unpaved. A rent in the earth lies at its center, like an
                              unclosed wound. Candles surround the fissure, giving it an eerie glow. The smell that
                              permeates this district has been described as mushroomy. Here and there, pilgrims
                              convulse in the street, tended by red-robed minders. The sound of overlapping glossolalia.

                              • Huff fumes: If you seek to huff the sacred fumes, the GM prepares a “Mad Lib”
                                for you. You provide adjectives, nouns, and verbs. The GM then reads the Mad
                                Lib to you. This is what you babble/prophesize during your trip. The GM may
                                use this nonsense prophecy in planning sections of the Underworld, if they wish.

                              The Street of Heretics
                              The Cult of Mythrys is the predominant religion in the City, but it is by no means
                              the only one. The Veneration of the Feathered Swine, the Followers of Issek of
                              the Jug, the Cult of the God Twins, the elven Tripartite, and dozens of other faiths
                              have significant numbers of adherents. These fringe religious communities gather
                              on the Street of Heretics. Congregating in a single district allows these minority
                              communities to avoid persecution and political pressures elsewhere. Because each
                              sect is more or less in the same boat, they are remarkably tolerant of each other.

                              Sensations:
                              Different architectural styles crowd the street: outdoor fanes jostle for position with
                              temples, shrines, cathedrals, and tabernacles. A riot of steeples. Religious costumes also
                              vary widely (although many of them feature strikingly tall hats). Prayers to a dozen
                              strange gods are uttered in a dozen languages. The smoke of incense roils towards the
                              heavens. A silver horn sounds: a call to worship.

                              Rumor:
                              The Church of the Snake’s doomsday recently came and went. This Day of
                              Second Skin was observed only by a few, and the prophesied end of the world
                              never quite materialized. However, adventuring guilds have recently reported
                              that a gigantic serpent has appeared within the Underworld. Could this giant
                              serpent be the one foretold by the Snake worshipers?

                              Special City Action:
                              • Strange communions: If you attend a religious service of importance to you,
                                you may draw Challenge cards from either the top of the deck, the top of the
                                minor arcana discard pile, or some combination of the two once during your
                                next expedition.

The Sidereal House
Because of the myriad smokes and discharges of the City, the stars are remote
and rare things. They are infrequently seen—except in the district of the Sidereal
House. The Sidereal House is a tower atop a high plateau, jutting defiantly up
from the urban sprawl. This institution seeks to understand the lights of the sky
and their significance for those who dwell on earth.

The Sidereal House is home to a sect of natural philosophers. These astronomers
calculate the motions and positions of various planets, their dance, conjunctions,
and the timing of eclipses. The Sidereal House is also home to many astronomical
tools: a (relatively simple) telescope, a (large and elaborate) orrery, and a
mechanical clock (the mechanisms of which dominate three floors of the tower).
It is the civic responsibility of the Sidereal House to track, record, and name
new years.

Sensations:
Mosaics personifying the zodiac, the constellations, and each planet. The tower itself is a
massive affair, and looks somewhat unsteady. At this height, the air is quite clear. It is cold
and good smelling. When you look up, you can actually see the stars twinkling above you.

Special City Action:
• As above so below: You may go stargazing at the Sidereal House. Draw the top
  three cards from the minor arcana deck and place them back in any order.


VIII OF WANDS
Garden of Ravenous Roses
The largest greenspace in the City is the Garden of Ravenous Roses. The district
is eerie and strange. It’s like if Central Park and Alice in Wonderland had a
lovechild. Mazes of hedgerows that lead nowhere. Rose bushes with spiraling,
sprawling arms reaching out to embrace you. Strange concentric circles of
mushrooms. But it’s also peaceful. Quiet. There are no birds or insects. The
whole place feels like it's holding its breath.

Sensations:
Too quiet. There are seventeen shades of green: fern, forest, jungle, laurel, lime. The flora
is strange and the fauna non-existent. There are fractal patterns almost everywhere. You
can hear a yoga class being taught not far from you.

Rumor:
Vampires (or anybody that needs blood to live, really) can actually be vegetarians
in the Garden of Ravenous Roses. Just pick a few flowers and eat those instead.
Same nutritious blood content.

Special City Action:
• Picnic: You may have a picnic in the terrible garden and invite other
  adventurers to come with you. In the same way that step 2 (break bread) of
  the Camp Phase can elicit interesting conversations (p. 189), this is explicitly
  an opportunity to share your own backstory and say something dramatic
  about your adventurer. Each person who participates in the picnic must share
  something unknown about their adventurer.

                              The Labyrinth
                              The Labyrinth is a tomb built by the Tyrant Emperor for himself: a mausoleum
                              of epic size and scope. Its winding passageways are unknown to any living mason
                              or architect because, upon completion, the Tyrant Emperor promptly executed
                              all who participated in its construction. It is built of brick, mortar, and blood.
                              When the City rebelled, the people sealed the Tyrant Emperor into his own
                              tomb: a poetic end for the last of a line of mad monarchs. Now, the Labyrinth
                              stands as a cursed and haunted blight on the City.

                              The disenfranchised are sometimes forced to live in its shadow, but (almost) no
                              one dares to cross its threshold. Those that do are never heard from again.

                              Sensations:
                              Like a wen on the face of the City, the Labyrinth bulges up in the middle of the metropolis.
                              It would be beautiful if it weren’t so grandiose. The Labyrinth is composed of red brick
                              and is perfectly circular. When seen from above, there’s an apparent spiral pattern. There
                              are many entrances into the structure, all bricked up—though the bricks are frequently
                              crumbling, and age has opened other holes in it as well.

                              Rumor:
                              The Tyrant Emperor isn’t dead. The hoi polloi played right into his hands. They
                              sealed him into his own tomb—the tomb where he knew the location of the secret
                              doors and hidden passages. He’s still alive down there. Stalking. Waiting. Eating
                              rats. One day, he will rise again.

                              Special City Action:
                              • Enter the Underworld: In actuality, the Labyrinth touches the Underworld. (Is
                                it responsible for the coming of the Underworld?) If you use this City Action,
                                your guild begins the Crawl in a random location in the Underworld. The GM
                                should randomly determine the location each time. It is never the same.

                              The Starfall Pit
                              When the star fell, everybody blamed the sorcerers. They did it. Them and
                              their foul magics. It devastated most of the City. Those that lived had to flee the
                              smoke and the dust. But—in time—many came back. They rebuilt. The City is
                              eternal. But few dared go near the Starfall Pit. Few who did returned. Those who
                              returned came back...wrong.

                              Sensations:
                              Ruins ring an ugly weeping wound in the earth. The air smells chemical. Your ears ring
                              in a way that you can feel in your genitals. You glimpse the pit. There is a glow, but the
                              light doesn’t illuminate anything. The glow flickers between two impossible colors, ulfire
                              and jale, that mingle in a weird, eerie way.

                              Special City Action:
                              • Visit the Pit: If you are foolish enough to go into the pit, pass your adventurer
                                sheet around the table. Each player at the table may alter or swap one thing on
                                your adventurer sheet within the normal bounds of the game. For example, they
                                could swap your Cups and Pentacles attributes, change your gender, change your
                                kith, etc. To you, this is normal. “I’ve always been like this,” you will insist.

The Broken Smiles District
Theater is a popular pastime in the City for both the commoners and the nobility.
The center of theatrical craft is the Broken Smiles District (the macabre name
comes from the symbol of a half-comedy, half-tragedy mask that represents the
borough). The district is like Broadway and the West End had a baby. Playhouses
abound. Its residents are all theater kids. They like to sing. Its residents are also
fiercely territorial: different families support different playing companies. The
rivalries are fierce. For example, if you’re a supporter of the Lord Governor’s
Men, don’t find yourself below Swan’s Street after dark.

Sensations:
There are always crowds of people, beggars, and cutpurses. Playhouses carry names as
fanciful as the taverns: the Curtain, the Bear-Baiter, Good Hope. For a half-coin, the
poor can stand on the rush-strewn floors of almost any theater. The wealthier can afford
more comfortable seating, coddle-cups of watered wine, and pretty decent sandwiches.
Plays run the gamut from comedies, passion plays, musicals, satyr plays, and tragedies.

Special City Action:
• The play’s the thing: For 25g, you can take one other person (either an
  adventurer or a GM character) out for an evening’s entertainment. Name the
  subject of the play you are going to see—it can be anything: murder, marriage,
  mortgages, money, etc. You may correctly gauge your companion’s opinion
  about this subject by observing their reaction to the play. This can give you
  insight into some subject they wish to keep hidden from you.


KNIGHT OF WANDS
The Temple of God’s Wives
In the days of the pagan god-kings, the sect of the God’s Wives—made up
of intersex and third gender persons—wielded enormous political influence.
Their status was sacred: it was death for one outside their order to touch them.
Today, the old temple is in ruins, but the district remains a haven for those
who fall outside of the gender binary. These diverse peoples band together as
a community in the Temple district to avoid unwelcome attention or political
persecution. Importantly, the traditions of the old cult are still passed on as
folklore in this district. There is much wisdom found in the sayings of the elders.

Sensations:
Like most of the City, the old is incorporated into the new. Ancient statues celebrating
the blending of the male and the female are kept in coats of fresh, vivid paint. The stucco
buildings are covered in painted shells. Wisteria is blooming. Dancing is accompanied by
the sound of drums and a flute.

Special City Action:
• Exchange gifts: An ancient tradition of hospitality is still practiced in this
  district: a gift is given for a gift received. Sometimes this is intentionally
  comedic: rubbish exchanged with pomp and circumstance. Sometimes this is a
  meaningful ceremony.

  Tell the GM what gift you are giving away. Test Cups. On a failure, you receive
  a small, funny item. On a success, you are given a random antique. The GM will
  tell you what it is.

                              The Tower Gnostic
                              Natural philosophers observe the world and make hypotheses about its workings.
                              They write bestiaries and herbologies, chronicle the passing of the seasons,
                              and track the position of the stars. The Tower Gnostic is made up of unnatural
                              philosophers. They posit the nature of the far realms, catalog the shapes of
                              daemons and devils, and theorize the nature of sorcery.

                              Not every member of the Tower Gnostic is a sorcerer, though many are.
                              The Tower’s focus is more on theory than practical application. For Tower
                              philosophers, the how is much more important than the doing. They aspire to
                              write treatises about magic, not actually cast spells. The City mostly tolerates the
                              Tower’s presence due to this apparent lack of ambition.

                              Tylwyth is spoken by most of the population in this district.

                              Sensations:
                              Hewn of black stones, the Tower is hunched like an old man, having been built on and
                              expanded a dozen times. It has its servants, maids, cooks, horse grooms, men-at-arms,
                              and otherwise, but it also hosts a collection of speculative philosophers in red-and-black
                              robes and zucchettos. They chatter to each other in low, animated voices as they hustle
                              past you. There’s a vague old person smell around here.

                              Rumor:
                              The Underworld opened up under the City when the Tower Gnostic summoned
                              a god from beyond the far realms. Each day, tunneling up from some deep hell,
                              His Majesty the Worm grows closer to those who bid Him come forth.

                              Special City Action:
                              • Research a new spell: If you want to introduce a new spell into the game, pitch
                                your idea to the GM. Your GM will suggest amendments or consult with the
                                rest of the table to nail down the wording of the mechanics. In general, new
                                spells should feel similar to those established in Appendix A: Sorcery.

                                • The GM will name the new spell. This name should be similar to the other
                                  spell names (e.g., Animate Object, Flare, Circle of Protection).

                                • Once the spell’s name has been established, you may pursue creation of this
                                  spell by taking this action. Spend 25g to draw 1 tile from a Scrabble bag. Your
                                  research is complete once you’ve spelled out the name of the spell you are
                                  researching.

                                • You may draw as many tiles per City Action as you can afford. Any tiles you
                                  pull for research are kept between City Phases until the research is complete.




326   APPENDIX D   |   CITY CREATION
KING OF WANDS
The Court of Wands
The City maintains a strained relationship with sorcerers. In some ways, it’s like
nuclear power. People like electricity, reducing pollution, and lower energy
costs, but they hate the big nuclear reactor ticking away in their backyard. It’s
the same thing with magic.

The Court of Wands is the City’s attempt to control sorcerers. Magical crimes,
such as unleashing maleficence or casting spells upon citizens, are punished by
the Court of Wands. Rogue sorcerers are hunted down and dispatched by the
Court without mercy. The sorcerous population of the City consent to this
scrutiny because they understand that true conflict with the powers of the City
would be disastrous.

The Court of Wands district is austere and sequestered, a tiny city-within-a-
city. Its population is mostly sorcerers, which means that it is diverse and utterly
weird. Few others dare to visit this district.

Tylwyth is spoken by most of the population in this district.

Sensations:
The architecture is bleak and unadorned. In contrast, the population is outrageous in style
of dress, fetish ornamentation, and body modification. Loud voices argue with each other
inside barren stone halls. Those that are magically inclined can feel the power kept checked
here, like energy in a coiled spring.

Special City Action:
• Join the Court of Wands: For 100g in dues, you may join the ranks of the
  Court of Wands. You are given an archwood staff. This can both be wielded as a
  polearm (p. 170) and release blasts of magical energy using the Gramarye talent.

      Making Your Megadungeon
      The Underworld is a megadungeon: a collection of interconnected dungeons. Each discrete
      dungeon acts as a thematic region of the Underworld. Each constituent dungeon is made
      up of individual rooms, populated with interesting things, monsters, traps, and treasures.


                                    As a GM, creating an Underworld megadungeon can seem daunting, but
                                    it’s really just a series of small, discrete tasks. The process of creating your
                                    Underworld is less about making one huge megadungeon and more about
                                    creating a series of interesting rooms and then creating interesting connections
                                    between them. The creation process is fun for the GM and the discovery
                                    process is fun for the players.

                                    Because the Underworld is the focus of the game, it needs to be large enough
                                    to keep players interested and engaged week after week. This appendix
                                    contains a procedure for creating your Underworld. By following these steps,
                                    you’ll have a working Underworld with a few hours of work.


                                    1. Origins of the Underworld
                                    You must understand the essential truths about the Underworld, even if this
                                    lore is kept secret from the players.

                                    3. Create Maps
                                    Create a keyed map of each dungeon’s rooms. These maps are player-facing
                                    even if the contents won’t be discovered until the players explore them.


                                    4. Write Room Descriptions
                                    Write down something interesting in each room for the players to interact with.


                                    5. Create the Meatgrinder
                                    Create a Meatgrinder (p. 91) for each individual dungeon level.

                                    Steps 1 and 2 are done once for the entire Underworld. Steps 3-5 are repeated
                                    for each dungeon level. Start at a small scale and repeat, over and over, until
                                    your underworld is truly mythic.

                                    Additionally, we provide dungeon seeds as inspirational prompts for the
                                    different levels of your Underworld—see page 343. You can use these dungeon

                                    own devising.

1. Origins of the Underworld
The Underworld is an interconnected and impossibly ancient kingdom—in the
past, each section had its own purpose in the greater scheme of the whole. The
Underworld is currently occupied by usurping monsters and explorers in a way
contradictory to its intended use.

The tension between these two truths drives much of the excitement the
Underworld offers.

You must decide the nature of your Underworld and what truths it holds.
Choose something that feels inspiring but prompts a lot of open-ended
questions.

• Is it Hell itself? Is it a prison for wicked souls to languish for eternity in
  ironic punishments?

• Is it the first kingdom of humanity? What is humanity’s relationship with
  dragons? Siblings? Master and slave?

• Is it a heaven usurped by ancient sorcerers? What repercussions did their
  intrusion cause for the cycle of death and rebirth?

• Is it the Garden of Eden, with the Trees of Knowledge and Life at the
  center? Are the traps designed by God Himself to ensure humanity never
  returned to paradise?

• Is it the Tomb of God? Why did God commit suicide?
• Is it the corpse of the World Giant, whose bones became the earth and
  blood became the oceans?

• Is it a series of stolen cities, each piled on each? What is the purpose of the
  mysterious Sisters who rule these stolen cities? Why must they never again
  see the sun?

Your decisions about the origins of the Underworld will color your decisions
about what the Underworld currently contains. Thus, as you build out the
levels of your Underworld, you’ll be guided by its foundations.


Dungeon lore
Remember the traps in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade? Embed lore and
information into each level of your Underworld. A trap can reflect the theme
of what it guards or its maker. Treasure might depict the scene of a historical
or recent event. The gold might be minted with the faces of ancient goddesses.
Ruins might have partial Rosetta Stones that allow the translation of unknown
and forgotten languages. Let your lore shine in dark places.

Ultimately, players might ignore all this as just a bit of flavor. And that’s okay—
the game is ultimately about the player’s choices. But, at the same time, if you
repeatedly hit your players over the head with bits of lore, they’ll begin to form
connections. Things that seemed like one-off bits of description will suddenly
be remembered. Players will have “aha” moments. They’ll feel like Sherlock
Holmes—and that’s fun for everybody.

If you want to create your own maps, follow these steps:

• Leave some space between each area.

Room descriptions define the permanent features of a dungeon: its dangers,
its treasures, and its denizens. Non-permanent features players may encounter            When writing room descriptions,

 shelves, five long shelves per side, cover all the sides except two;

                                     warping influence seeps out of their prison-tombs. Each room of the Inverted Castle seems
                                     to be decorated by someone who has only heard about humans through unreliable ancient
                                     historians and seen pictures of their lives through crude art. The rooms appear to be set
                                     to some purpose, but there’s little logic to the layout, decoration, or inventory. Disparate
                                     concepts are juxtaposed. Certain rooms are laid out nonsensically, e.g., an entire wing is

                                              Ruin is the name of the first City. Here, humanity first learned about the joys and terrors
                                              of being alive. The iconography of the place is full of the strength and beauty of youth. This
                                              is in sharp contrast to the current melancholy state of this level: dilapidated, derelict, and
                                              disfigured. During the first Crusades into the Underworld, it was discovered that the first
                                              City was plated with gold. Subsequent expeditions by adventuring guilds have stripped
                                              almost all gold from this dungeon level. Much of the remaining wealth is so large and
                                              unwieldy it would be difficult to extract. Ruin was pulled into the Underworld by His
                                              Majesty the Worm. His reasons are (as usual) enigmatic.

                                             Burning books create a heavy smoke that trickles down into the Underworld. The soot
                                             of this smoke is scraped and harvested by the ancient and unknowable cyclops librarians,
                                             who then painstakingly use it to restore the original uncensored texts. The culmination
                                             of their work lines the walls of the Library Heretical. It is said that the librarians do not

                                             in the psychic residue. Still, as a result of their efforts, the Library Heretical contains a
                                             vast wealth of knowledge from every age of the Wide World.

                                             Philosophers have speculated that humans were not the first people to govern where the
                                             City now stands. The Sepulcher of Titans supports these attestations. Here, the bodies
                                             of gigantic creatures lie in unquiet repose. The titans are not dead, merely dismembered.
                                             Their decapitated heads sit silently, thinking and watching. If you hooked a bellows up to

                                             arms are freed from their coffins, they crawl around blindly, looking for their bodies. If you
                                             pull their hearts from their canopic jars, you’ll find them still beating. (Do not under any
                                             circumstances eat the titans’ flesh.)

                                        When the first human died, it took everybody by surprise. As necromancers furiously tried
                                        to solve the problem of eternal life, one sorceress took a bold new approach. This sorceress
                                        had a daughter and named her Xania. She named them all Xania. Through magic, she
                                        cloned her daughter thousands upon thousands of times. The sorceress automated these
                                        processes, and has long since perished. The processes continue. Xania survives. In an
                                        enchanted tower in the Underworld, magical cloning labs work continuously to unstitch
                                        and reweave the same person, over and over. There are hundreds of Xanias. Some are
                                        saner than others, but none are particularly sane. At least, not how humans think of it.

                                              When the first human died, it took everybody by surprise. Nobody knew that would
                                              happen. Life had seemed to be eternal. Nobody could remember a time before being alive,
                                              and nobody had yet conceived of a time after being alive. The revelation that they would
                                              someday die terrified the first City. To solve this problem, humanity sought the aid of
                                              sorcery. Unfortunately, sorcery is a sword without a hilt: there’s no safe way to hold it.
                                              The result of the first City’s invention of necromancy is the Necropolis of Ot.

                                             spirits dwell. It takes human commerce and turns it up a notch. Spirits trade intangible
                                             things: the color of your eyes, the memory of your mother, your sense of fear. In return?
                                             They give you (almost) anything you want. It is impossible to buy your heart’s desire.
                                             However, many spirits have powerful tools that would make achieving your quest
                                             much simpler. They are willing to trade these things to you for a price. The costs of the
                                             Hellmarkt seem reasonable. Too reasonable. Alas, no mortal has ever made this bargain
                                             and avoided regret.

                                      The Underworld is the cradle and grave of all things, including concepts. Like Plato’s

                                      in its dark dreams, the germ has taken root and spread into an infestation of hallways,

                                            The clockwork mechanisms that define the Augury exceed contemporary science. It’s like
                                            the Antikythera mechanism taken to a castle scale, with rooms of gears and cogs housed by
                                            limestone walls. Its intended purpose is bafflingly obscure. The only signifying elements
                                            are found in three separate orreries, which depict detailed but utterly alien skyscapes.
                                            However, clever dungeon denizens and adventurers have found many seemingly
                                            unintended uses for the Augury. Time seems especially fickle here. Food doesn’t spoil,
                                            but molds grow quickly. Hours seem to pass in minutes. Bright light causes paper to act
                                            photoreactive, capturing shadow imprints. Is this obscure mechanism responsible for the

                                       Although the supply chain and logistics are impossible to manage, a colony of underfolk
                                       have settled near this lode in an attempt to try and mine it. Unfortunately, mithril
                                       mining is incredibly unhealthy. Though mining has made the Truesilver Forge colony
                                       rich, it has also made them deeply disturbed. They’re suspicious and suffer hallucinations.
                                       Anybody who spends too long on this level begins to suffer these effects as well. Sorcerers
                                       should note that mithril increases the potency of magic (kind of like nega-iron). The
                                       presence of so much mithril at this level has strange, unpredictable effects on spells.

                                          bodies go on to provide nutrients to the White Gardens. The White Gardens are fields of

                                        how or why dragons do anything. Orcs call this city the Dragonbone Memorial. A sect of
                                        religious fanatic orcs believes the Dragonbone Memorial to be their promised land. There
                                        is inter-factional disagreement about whether they should lead the orcish nations down

Creating interesting rooms
The basic procedure for populating a dungeon is this: Come up with a bunch of
interesting ideas and write them down. This is just as easy and hard as it sounds. Using
the principles for creating interesting room descriptions (p. 335), add features to each
room. Some example features and inspiration for creating your own are provided below.
There are twenty-one of them, so you can flip over a major arcana card to quickly select
one if you desire randomness.

1. Circle of power                                                3. Cage

      Elevators are platforms or chambers that move around
      the dungeon (vertically, horizontally, or in stranger
      ways). Different levels of the Underworld may be
      connected by elevators that need to be activated.

      Example
      The guild steps into the bottom of a deep pit. A colossal
      chain ending in a huge hook dangles from an unseen
      place high above. A giant earthworm is pierced by the
      hook, wiggly feebly. If the guild manages to make a
      significant pull on the chain, the giant at the top of the
      pit pulls the hook and chain up to the upper level. He’s
      not interested in the guild and will discard them at this
      upper level as being “under his limit.”

be used to travel rivers to hitherto inaccessible sections.

Example
The River Phlegethon looks like a normal river but the
water is acidic, earning it the nickname the “River of
Fire.” It exudes a noxious, sulfurous scent. Any normal
item submerged into the waters is quickly destroyed.

If the guild can persuade Iago the Lion-Turtle to take
them onto his back, he can wade and withstand the
waters of this river, ferrying them to the other side.


20. Waterwheel
Waterwheels harness the power of the strange rivers of
the Underworld. Adventurers may find the state of the
dungeon changed if a waterwheel is stopped or started.

Example
The flow of the river is split into three waterfalls by
a series of locks and dams controlled by levers inside
the dungeon. When the water turns the northern
waterwheel, the colossal door to the Necropolis of Ot
is raised. When the water turns the eastern waterwheel,
the lamps inside the Castle of Crossed Destinies are
lit, allowing adventurers to forgo carrying their own
torches. When the water turns the western waterwheel,
the bridge extends from the castle towards the City of
Ruin. Only one waterfall can flow at a time.

                                             Players should be able to easily experiment to determine how caustic the waters

      Ghosts, which you can use to try out His Majesty the Worm.

                                            Brainstorming
                                            Imagine a tomb that was once the resting place of a magical royal family, but
                                            is currently occupied by a pair of brain spiders. The brain spiders excavated the
                                            former tombs to make a nest for themselves.

                                            • Reading over the notes about brain spiders in the Bestiary (Appendix C, p.
                                              256), it feels like these creatures are Saturday morning cartoon villains, so that
                                              will inform some of our choices.

                                            • To give the brain spiders a bit more teeth, let’s give them some spell-casting
                                              abilities, too. Casting illusions has a mad genius bend to it.

                                            The inhabitants of the tomb probably don’t like their resting places defiled.
                                            There are ghosts.

                                            • Because the ghosts are royalty, they appear to be made of pure gold.
                                            • It would be cool if the ghosts were contained the spiders’ webs. We’ll say the
                                              webs effect both tangible and intangible creatures. When the guild explores,
                                              they might destroy these webs. This is a good way to change the dungeon
                                              mid-exploration.

      • Impermeable Membrane. Slimes are immune to
        slashing weapons (like swords) and crushing weapons
        (like hammers). They take damage as normal from
        sharp, piercing attacks (like from arrows, daggers, or
        spears).

      • Salt Reactive. If an adventurer has salt in hand, they
        can attempt to throw it onto a slime. This is treated
        as an Attack that inflicts 2 Wounds to the slime on a
        success.

      • Shapeless Body. Slimes are immune to being
        Displaced, Rooted, or Tripped.
